title: "Driving in India"
---

I have been driving a lot for the last 1 month. It has given me a slew of opportunities to experience India and its people in their truest sense. In about 40 days that I have driven my car, I have **traveled exactly 3400 kilometers** (yes I checked) in and around my city. That equates to about **85 kilometers every single day**; most of which has been in the urban Ahmedabad. 

The picture I present here is very gloomy. Those 3400 kilometers have seemed like a lifetime on the road. Driving in India requires a special set of skills that would enable you to predict just about anything coming in your way while you are trying to shift up to the top gear. On countless occasions, I have had to unwillingly switch lanes because of a group of cows sitting on the road. They were marked and 'owned' cows and hence I could see that their owner just let them wander about on the road without a care in the world. On number of occasions, I have encountered people driving on the wrong side of the road and giving me an angry stare because I blocked their 'way'. Ghastly.

That is not even the whole story. The **parking** is the worst. I know and understand that it's a big problem in even the most developed parts of the world, but does anything justify parking your car on the road and peacefully rejoicing in the delicious street food while other commuters honk their brains out to move you out of their way? Loathsome. 

**Lane discipline** is something I fear we Indians might never learn. It's supremely important and necessary in the event of a traffic jam and following a disciplined lane behavior can lead to a very healthy resolution of a traffic jam. Do we care? No! We would try and latch on to every single chance we get to enter in to a different lane that we think is moving faster than our own. The result? Chaos.

Fellow drivers driving on the road are also very **inconsiderate.** 'Sorry' and 'Thank you' seem totally over the top when something happens (e.g. when someone bumps his car in to yours). When you let someone pass ahead of you, he would behave as if you gave him what was rightfully his and for that he doesn't need to thank you at all. And don't be surprised if someone spews some stupid curry on to your windshield. It's all allowed. Courtesy and consideration for fellow drivers dies a pathetic death every single moment. 

I, having returned from the Netherlands, expected some amount of discipline in the way people drive here in India. You may say that I am wrong in expecting that from people here, but I don't think so. That is why I even get angry and really mad at people who do not observe regulations. I even go out of my way to make them aware of the fact that they did something wrong (I even took it to the traffic policemen yesterday when I saw them carelessly letting a crossroad choke up with traffic and not giving a damn about it). I think people realising they are doing something wrong is the first step in the direction of everyone following a decorum of road discipline. 

The problem is very simple - **We don't care.** Not because we do not love the country or are unhappy with the Government, but because we are too busy with our own problems to give a damn about the country. We all think if we take care of our own lives and our own selves, the country will take care of itself. I will be honest here - the Government has provided our state and the city (I am being discreet here since I can only certify for the roads I have traveled on) with roads of utmost quality and standards. We have all the facilities we can possibly imagine (be it the road signs, reflectors, indicators and more) and that is never the problem. The problem is the people. It's the way they treat these resources and facilities. They feel they 'own' them. They feel they 'own' the roads. **A lot of times when I see a couple of brats wrongfully blocking the whole way with their expensive shiny car that their parents bought them, I think 'Yes, this is exactly what your parents raised you for'.**

Driving in India is not fun. Especially not in the urban environments. **It results in a very inefficient use of your time, fuel and money due to the senselessly unhealthy commute conditions.** Not to mention the inexorbitant amount of pollution. To be honest, it's a sorry sight. And to say we are all a part of it makes me cringe with agony every single day.
