So this came as a complete surprise and a very happy one at that.

*So here's a little background story:*

**I had been on the lookout for a shorter domain for a while** - for about 6 months (and even without such a need, I'm always on the lookout for great domains and I get a lot of flak for it as well). Because I'm a nerd, a few extra characters in the domain name feel awkward and ungainly to me. So I searched for all alternatives of my name and couldn't find many that were still available. My name is fairly common in Indian culture and hence it's futile to expect such domains to be available.

So I looked for options. [Domainr](http://domai.nr) is a great tool if you are like me. It shows multiple options with all possibilities around your name. It showed that **hardik.io** was available. The thing with **.io** domains is that they are really expensive. I wasn't ready to commit to spending $50/year for life especially knowing that it's an [injustice done by the British](http://gigaom.com/2014/06/30/the-dark-side-of-io-how-the-u-k-is-making-web-domain-profits-from-a-shady-cold-war-land-deal/). Plus it was't a **.com** or a **.org**! So it was a no.

The **.co** domains were all the rage till a year ago. So I hopped on the trend. I had a brief spell with **hardik.co** but I didn't enjoy it much. Since I found so many people assuming it was a **.com** when I spelled it out over phone. Giving out an email with such a TLD is a nightmare. I missed a lot of emails. So that had to end.

<div class="aside"><strong>No other variations of "hardik" were available.</strong> Not at least in the standard set of TLDs. So I stopped there. I kept what I had - <strong>hardikpandya.com</strong>, lengthy but trusted, verified and very old (in domain terms, an old domain bears a lot of value in terms of search-engine trust).</div>

## Making a move for hardik.org and hardik.com

So the first real attempt at recovering either hardik.org or hardik.com was made 2 months ago. I fired up a [DomainAgents](http://domainagents.com) account and made offers. I was new back then in this whole domain-dealing craft. So I sent some basic offers from DA's interface. I put $500 for hardik.org and $700 for hardik.com. Whois records for both domains showed that they were owned by some party in the US. I was hoping literally nothing from the whole DA offer attempt. At best I expected an immediate rejection or perhaps even worse - no response from the owners. So there was that.

2 weeks later I received a response from DA that they couldn't contact the owners of respective domains and if I wanted to try for a different domain. That was it. If they were saying so, perhaps they wanted me to increase the bid or they were actually unable to reach the owners. **I gave up.** Because to be honest, even if the bid was accepted, I wasn't really sure if I would've paid so much to get either of those domains.

### Fast forward to today

Today morning, I opened up Domainr and checked what was happening. First I queried **hardik.com**. It's been registered through October 2016. So that's not happening anytime soon.

**Then I tried hardik.org and it said it was available!** I was a bit skeptical. Since the thing with Domainr is that they sometimes take a few seconds to update the availability status of a domain. So a domain that looks available might not actually be available and you won't come to know the real status unless you click on the domain from the list and wait for 4-5 seconds to let it update.

	<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/hardikorg.png" style="border: 1px solid #f1f1f1;">
	<figcaption>It remained available after those 5 seconds</figcaption>
</figure>

I let those anxious seconds fly. The status didn't change. **The domain was really available.** At standard .org domain pricing too! I couldn't believe this. I had a chance to buy the domain I wanted for no extra money at all (I smiled a little knowing I had offered $500 for this).

<div class="box">The time that elapsed from that moment I came to realize the domain was really available to the moment I owned the domain was 50 seconds.</div>

I was not going to let this one slip.

So from today, I own **hardik.org** and would setup this site on it in a couple of days. Even the email would be hosted on this new domain (hardik@hardik.org). Old domain and email address would work forever.

Such days bring much joy to my life. Because I'm a nerd. A proud one at that.
