Bitcoins have been a revelation lately. Ever since the great price spike of [November/December 2013 when it peaked at more than $1200/BTC](http://blogs.marketwatch.com/thetell/2013/11/29/bitcoin-hits-record-1242-as-it-nears-value-of-ounce-of-gold/), it's been in the news for good and bad reasons.

But it has its roots in cryptography. Cryptography is based completely on random numbers and mathematics around randomness. This randomness forms basis of encryption and authentication which leads to the widely used public-key and private-key algorithm. Bitcoin and blockchains (bitcoin's decentralised ledger) makes use of public/private-keys for initiating and authenticating transactions and keeping scores of balances.

This article explains how **currencies and payments can be handled without any central authority (e.g. Banks) and how they can be executed in a fast and secure manner, worldwide.** The future looks bright for bitcoins and the science behind it is even more astonishing. This is frankly the best explanation of the way bitcoins work, that I've seen.
