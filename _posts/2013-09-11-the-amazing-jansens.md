title: "The Amazing Jansens"
---

Apologies for posting this a little late (as things go in India). 

A few articles ago, I wrote about my spacebox that I grew out of. As the contract ended, I was looking for a house to stay in. I requested Bart's parents to host me if possible and they happily agreed to it. So yes, I spent a week (the previous one) at a Dutch family's house and a really gorgeous house at that.

I had heard a lot of stories about how it would take a lot to actually befriend people from foreign countries but this has been smooth and special. The Jansens have been tremendously nice.

**To Ben and Mieke (and also to Bart)**, thanks for being so lovely and excellent hosts (while I hope I was a good guest). I am really grateful for that wonderful stay at your house. You became a family away from my own family. The Indian dinner night was pretty nice as well (I expect to be good at other Indian delicacies as well).

A very few occasions and experiences make their way into our collage of lifetime memories, and this one is right up there.
