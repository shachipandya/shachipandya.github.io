Seldom do we get to read such stuff. Impressive journalism.

As I wrote in my [previous article](http://hardikpandya.com/2014/05/24/design-is-contextual/) about design conjugated with proper context, Mark Kawano, former designer at Apple has this to say:

>Apple designers (and engineers!) will often come up with clever interactive ideas--like 3-D cube interfaces or bouncy physics-based icons--during a bit of their down time, and then they might sit on them for years before they make sense in a particular context.

Makes perfect sense.

Another gem:

>“The reality is, the people who thrived at Apple were the people who welcomed that desire and passion to learn from working with Steve, and just really were dedicated to the customer and the product. They were willing to give up their weekends and vacation time. **And a lot of the people who complained that it wasn’t fair . . . they didn’t see the value of giving all that up versus trying to create the best product for the customer and then sacrificing everything personally to get there.**”

That is why the Cupertino giant is home to the pantheons of design today.

Top notch stuff.
