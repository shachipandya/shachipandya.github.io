title: "You can't have stuff for free"
---

Internet began with this horrible idea of "free". It inbred the sense in people that they can actually have stuff for free. Like email, information, knowledge and communication.

So well it did. But it was a slow poison. It ruined people for the worst imaginable mudslide in the idea of creating stuff and making a living - *expecting stuff for free*. People started believing that the Internet is created for them to have access to everything for free, which it was. But since it was free, the people who created content and made those amazing websites could see no way to make money for the work they did. They weren't doing charity. They were spending nights and days for the hard work they put in.

If the Internet had from the beginning, some system like "you get what you pay for", we wouldn't be shivering at the idea of privacy-breaches in this age where the free-stuff makers have to poke their eyeballs into the private lives of people to monetise the data since people aren't paying upfront for their product.

Technology played a big part in things being the way they are. **Payments were not easy to execute on the Internet since Internet itself was in its primal stages and didn't have the necessary security walls in place to have such a luxury.** PayPal and Stripe were unheard of and didn't make their way until late 2000s. Since there was no way to pay/exchange money online, the model never came into existence (of course, today we have bitcoins and [Stellar](http://hardikpandya.com/2014/08/01/stellar-payment/)).

The great digital sin of this great digital age. Monetising the brand of underwear people wear. Monetising my house's internal data. Monetizing the hours and the quality of sleep I get. You get the point.

Nobody wants to work for free. Everyone wants to be paid for the work they put in. But people were spoiled by the idea of free access to apps, websites and products. They just don't want to pay.

So the creators extract money (unfortunately) the hard way. The bad way. They peek into your private life. They demand for selfish and unreasonable permissions to track you, track your daily routine and then sell the data to marketers who can pay them for their work. This evil chain doesn't stop.

Imagine if Google had kept Gmail a paid product for the mass-market (I know it started out as a student-only thing at Stanford). Sure, it would have kept most people away from it and it must have not made sense business-wise at the moment. But it doesn't make sense at this moment either. From a completely different standpoint of users. Now they all outrage about Google reading their mails. Now they all outrage about Google putting prying cookies in their browsers to monitor their activity online. Well, it's the users who played a big part in creating this situation in the first place.

Today, people rage-comment on Hacker News when a developer asks $3.99 for the amount of work he did to make an app that people use everyday. It's a once-time purchase and perhaps a 1-2 years of continuous usage. Don't want to pay for the app? Be ready to have incessant ads because how else would that developer feed his family? **[Here's an amazing take from Jeff Atwood](http://blog.codinghorror.com/app-pocalypse-now/) on this matter.**

**Pay for stuff. If you like someone's product, PAY for it.** That's how it was meant to be. Don't expect to get it for free. Imagine if you had to hopelessly scamper around finding ways to monetize your product the evil way just because people wouldn't buy it and you gave it away for free.
