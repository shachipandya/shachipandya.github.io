title: "Some constructive thoughts"

Here are some constructive thoughts (they are free to use, as always) - 

* Patience is a valuable virtue. People do not always behave the way you expect them to.
* Peace of mind is in being in the moment. Always live and breathe wherever and with whoever you are.
* Social networks are fads. Minimize the time spent on them. Pick up the goddamn phone (relate this to staying in touch with your loved ones). 
* There are far better things to do in life than checking social updates and watching TV (relate this to the time you spend watching TV, reduce your screentime to only one sport you like the most - for me, it's football. Aggressively chuck the rest).
* Anger is better spared for your ownself when you underperform (use anger to motivate you to do the right thing and perform better).
* Spending time with family is gold. And so is learning new things constantly (nothing to add here).
* Watch what you eat. Things can turn pretty wild if you don't monitor your food intake (pleasing your tongue is not the best way to do this).
* Collaborate with geniuses. Be it for any project, any event or any meeting, work with them and learn from them (relate this to taking up interesting projects to work on, with people who know more than you).
* Ambition is infectious. Absorb it from wherever you can.
* Time > Money.

I will add more things to the list.
