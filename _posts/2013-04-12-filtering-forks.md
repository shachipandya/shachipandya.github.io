Internet is a huge pool of content on which every day, hundreds of thousands of hours worth of new content is added. A statistic from their official site says there are a total of [63 million+ blogs using WordPress](http://en.wordpress.com/stats/) (that is wordpress.com so even more in total considering the hosted version of WP). 

With so much content available on Internet, can you consume it all? Of course not. That is why it is important to find your neighbourhood on the Internet. It is the group of people with shared interests and passion from whom you can learn and get useful information. ​Rest all is junk (at least to you). Rest all is a waste of time. Set your information filters alright and you will master your web.

On the Internet, influx of information happens mostly through platforms like Twitter, [App.net](http://app.net) and [RSS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) (and no, not Facebook). These can be very overwhelming to handle if not configured properly. Plus they function very differently and hence some amount of dexterity is needed to create a relevant information stream tailored for you - one that brings news and bits that you are interested in and not everything produced every single second on the Internet.   ​ 

​On Twitter, I use the 70-30 rule to follow people. Out of the 250 odd people I follow, 70% are the ones I can trust in terms of the content-topics they produce. This majority is the niche that I enjoy reading about and the group of people I like to be a part of. I know what these 70% people are going to write, or at least I can expect what they produce would mostly be of interest to me. For me, this group of people includes programmers, developers, friends, bands that I follow and a few very good tech journalists. I strongly recommend not following more than about 250 people. Of course it constantly evolves but I do take care that when I find one really good person to follow on Twitter, I unfollow a celebrity and 'free-up' space on my timeline (because hey, I don't want to know what Ricky Gervais had for breakfast!).

But of course this is a tricky situation since I can also miss important updates that I might want to get outside that niche. That is the 30%. This minority contains people from different domains like sports, science, current topics, music/movies and world news. I normally go through their posts at a glance and only focus on what is relevant. I follow some people related to sports because they only tweet during a sporting event and hence it's alright.

Next inflow of content for most people (at least for me) is RSS. Trust me, RSS is your friend. It's the best thing to have happened to reading digitally and reading online. ​I personally follow all my favorite authors via RSS. It's as simple as picking up their feed link and putting it in your desired RSS syncing service. After that, you will never miss a single article from them. I follow about 35 authors (their blogs) via RSS which includes people like [Coding Horror](http://codinghorror.com), [Patrick Rhone](http://patrickrhone.com) and [Shawn Blanc](http://shawnblanc.net) who constantly write stuff that I almost always love to read. 

Of course it took me a while to identify these people. But what helped me was Twitter's suggestion engine. I followed some interesting people and it instantly started showing me more related writers that I might like. Well, I did like them! So right now I am in a phase where I know my 'niche' on the Internet and hence I have configured my information filters alright. In other words, I have found my 'neighbourhood' on Internet.​

So when I pick up my RSS feed or Twitter feed every morning with a cup of coffee, I know that there will not be a useless pile of celebrity news but actual relevant information that I so fondly enjoy reading. It will take time to search for good, passionate and quality people in your domain but once you do and set up your tools, you will waste far less time on the Internet.

​So go and find your web-neighbourhood!
