title: "Fastmail: Geek-safehouse for Email"
---

I've been on a long [Google abstinance](http://hardikpandya.com/2013/03/26/quitting-google/). So I have long quit Gmail. Hotmail is pathetic and they recently shut off the support for custom domain (I host my email on my own domain so this is important to me). Anyway Hotmail (or Outlook? or Live?) had started to suck so much lately that it almost never became a viable option. And that is how I had landed on Fastmail (about a year ago) and have been using it ever since.

I love it and it's the best (so far). Fastmail is a no-nonsense email service. It's paid. You pay money and you get hosted email awesomeness. You are the customer.

In this increasingly shitty surveillance crap ruining the privacy scene altogether, non-invasive products are rewarded with a lot of attention and affection. Especially Fastmail. Nowadays it's busy accruing a lot of angry Gmail outcasts.

It's so good even [Derek Sivers recommends it](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7794703). 

### What works for Fastmail

* It's fast. The web interface and mobile-site both.
* It's pure IMAP unlike Gmail's clunkily supported crap-IMAP.
* Awesome IMAP import. Back when I imported mails from Gmail to Fastmail, it tool all but 11 minutes to migrate 3400+ mails.
* No ads. None. They also don't need to creep you out by reading/scanning your emails.
* It's not owned by a US based company but an Australian company. Legally, they are off-limits to the NSA at least as of now.
* Amazing custom domain support.
* Amazing customer support (have tested this).
* It's paid. And this is a [huge advantage](http://www.marco.org/2011/04/05/let-us-pay-for-this-service-so-it-wont-go-down).

### Some cons for the mention

* There's no Push email. Your IMAP clients have to fetch mails by polling Fastmail servers at intervals. But hey, this means you get your email within 15 minute intervals max. It's definitely fine.
* Some may not like the web interface. I love it.
* Its spam filtering takes some efforts on your part to be setup perfectly. Take some time out for initial few days to setup your filters and you're good to go.
* Complex documentation of basic custom domain and alias setup. 

But there's nothing you cannot do with Fastmail provided you spend some time on setting it up properly. It has *everything* you need from an email provider.

Earlier this year, they opened beta of their **CalDAV server** as well.

Forget the cons. Seriously. This is coming from a longterm user of Fastmail (I'm on the $40/year [*Enhanced*](https://www.fastmail.fm/signup/personal.html) plan). It's amazing and is [trusted by the industry-protagonists](https://twitter.com/marcoarment/status/340884795255037952).

The freedom from extra-creepiness of Google would be another very welcome outcome of moving to Fastmail.
