title: Southern India
---

There's just too much beauty to enthral and amaze you in those green mountains on the banks of the river [Kaveri](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauvery). Southern part of India is as culturally diverse as India can be with spectacular amalgamation of various nature, food and people. A visit there generally fills you up with refreshment and rejuvenation. 

This month, I, with our family, went there and spent a lot of time around [Coorg (Kodagu)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coorg) and in the [Nilgiri mountain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nilgiri_mountains) range. Even in these peak summer days, the weather was pleasant all those days (as weather there normally is) - a big plus. It was a much needed respite from the sapping mid-40s of Ahmedabad.

### Here's how the trip went

**Ahmedabad - Bengaluru - Mysore - Coorg - Masinagudi - Ooty**

For the nature and wildlife enthusiasts, there's a lot to look forward to. The [Bandipur and Mudumalai National Parks](https://www.google.co.in/search?q=bandipur+national+park&client=safari&rls=en&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=Kx2pU5_uEs61uATT14DoCg&ved=0CAkQ_AUoAg&biw=1280&bih=664#q=bandipur+national+park&rls=en&tbm=isch) are rich habitats of numerous predators like tigers, leopards, bison and herbivores like spotted deer, wild elephants and more. There is also an ample amount of bird-watching opportunities. Some of the birds we saw were the ones we saw for the first time in our lives (not surprising considering the urban scrapers make it impossible for those birds to live in/around cities nowadays).

A shout-out for the [awesome (not so diverse) food](https://www.google.co.in/search?q=bandipur+national+park&client=safari&rls=en&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=Kx2pU5_uEs61uATT14DoCg&ved=0CAkQ_AUoAg&biw=1280&bih=664#q=south+indian+food&rls=en&tbm=isch) that is nowadays a hallmark of this region of India. You can't miss it here.

Here, I share some of the pictures I took there (definitely not the all the best ones).
