title: "Paramount ownership"
---

Nowadays lives have become digital. I mean so much so that almost all of our information resides on the Internet (not even on static computers anymore with the growing popularity of cloud services). This brings more worries than peace of mind actually. I am looking at you Gmail! 

Companies like Google take advantage of the fact that they are controlling the terms in return for a free service. It's no longer a secret that they scan (using algorithms) the contents of the inboxed emails and also monitor our activities online to serve advertisements to us (after all, we are getting something for free and the advertisers pay for the service uptime). The data residing in the inbox is almost comically owned by Google and they can wishfully pull the plug on it. I would not believe even a single word from their Terms and Conditions regarding Gmail. The server side outages and other downtimes have caused hassles so many times. Recently, they stopped serving email to my inbox for more than 24 hours. I almost ended up in a verbal duel with 3 people because I thought that my not receiving emails was their fault. Contacting customer support? We are not customers here! Customers are those who pay. We don't.   

I do not want to face the consequences of not having served my email or files on time due to a below-par (free, whatever) service. I do not mind paying and it's becoming quite normal to spend money on something as crucial and as critical as email (I know email has been free all these years and it sounds almost anarchic but it's time that we look into the data ownership matter a bit more seriously). Marco Arment explained it long back and remains one of the best arguments against relinquishing control of your data.

So, bottom-line is that I have switched to FastMail, a paid IMAP email server that has a much better service (so far) and a much better support. As Marco said, it had a downtime of less than 1 hour since it started. The fact that makes it great is that the support people are answerable to you because you actually are the customer. Since FastMail does not have to serve you advertisements, it has no incentive in scanning your private emails. Simple as that. So as far as Gmail is concerned, I bid adieu.

However, one of the awesome advantages of owning a personal domain is that my email address does not change. I just mapped it to FastMail's mail server and it's working straight-up. 

Nothing worth having in this world comes for free.
