title: "Twitter for iOS Dark Mode Concept"
subtitle: "A dark-themed mockup of Twitter for iOS"
---

For the past 1 month, I have switched to the official iOS Twitter app for using Twitter on iPhone. I used Tweetbot before but Twitter's complicated API policies made Tweetbot not capable of leveraging the new features Twitter launched.

A full-blown Twitter client comparison can be [found here](http://www.macstories.net/stories/twitter-clients-in-2014/) that explains why Twitter's own iOS app is your best bet going forward because Twitter's closing down the new features by not allowing them into its API.

## On to Twitter for iOS

So Twitter's official app is not that bad. In fact it has the Discovery tab that I really like. But switching from Tweetbot is not unnoticeable. I mean I do miss certain things.

<div class="aside">Most importantly, I miss the Dark Mode theme.</div>

As you may have noticed on my site's homepage as well, **I love less contrast and comfortable dark background reading.** Twitter's app is all white with the iconic blue thrown in all over the app.

>Lots of white makes the screen almost blinding at night when I'm going through tweets. It also affects battery a lot since Twitter's my most used app on the phone. All-white interface also makes it hard to distinguish important details around the tweets.

## Hence the Conceptual Redesign

So what did I do? I opened up Sketch.app and made a redesign that I would love using myself. Now I know Twitter probably won't integrate this in the app any time soon but I took it upon myself as a design challenge and out of curiosity to see how it would look if they did make a dark mode available in the app.

### Here's My Concept

<figure class = "small">
	<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/darkmode.png">
	<figcaption>Dark mode theme for Twitter for iOS</figcaption>
</figure>

Granted, it looks very similar to the dark mode in Tweetbot. But here's where it can be different: **functional performance and operational design.** The app can have the same operations, menus and flow that it has right now and just have a visual dark mode.

Here's how it looks side by side -

<figure class = "minified">
	<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/sidebyside.png">
	<figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>

<div class="aside">Much better, right?</div>

Now as you might have noticed, I changed the main body fonts in the mockup. It's Proxima Nova since it looks much more readable in the *light* weight on dark backgrounds. I prefer it to Helvetica Neue of the original app.

### *Update*

So I've gone ahead and made a profile view as well. Again, both views are conceptually very different and they highlight completely different details that require a re-thinking of the design completely. This page looks visually pleasant since I've had more liberties here than the default timeline view which doesn't leave much room for innovation.

<figure class = "small">
	<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/darkmodeprofile.png">
	<figcaption>Dark mode profile view</figcaption>
</figure>

And this is the profile view side by side -

<figure class = "minified">
	<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/sidebysidedarkprofile.png">
	<figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>

As it goes, the source .sketch file for the profile page is also available below for download.

## Made with Sketch.app

This mockup was made exclusively with Sketch.app and all its vector goodness. If you're interested in fiddling with the actual design file, go ahead by all means.
