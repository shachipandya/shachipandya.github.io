Kim (Megaupload-fame) [tweeted](https://twitter.com/KimDotcom/status/380757105298268160) something that puts thoughts in motion over piracy on a global scale. Actually, he hits a couple of points home. 

Here's how things should be done:

> * Create great content
> * Make it easy to buy (ridiculously important!)
> * Same day global release (again, ridiculously important!)
> * Works on any device
> * Fair price

All in all, it's not that people do not want to pay for quality. They do! Otherwise how could you explain all the iPhone and MacBook sales? 

The problem is the availability and the ease of buying - critical barriers that lead to piracy.
