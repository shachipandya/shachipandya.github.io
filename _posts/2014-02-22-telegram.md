title: "Switching to Telegram"
---

There is a lot of buzz in the space of instant messenging services ever since WhatsApp got acquired by Facebook. WhatsApp had a pretty user-friendly privacy policy until everything changed when the acquisition happened.

Read here the point mentioned in WhatsApp's privacy terms. It clearly says that they reserve the right to provide the information to their buyer company without the consent of the user. *Alarm bells?*

I'm a privacy freak to be honest. And you should be one too since nowadays there are literally no guarantees as to where your private data may end up. I really don't want to exchange personal photos with Shachi or any other family member over WhatsApp. And why do that when there's a nice and secure way of doing so available at no cost. In comes [Telegram](http://telegram.org).

**Why Telegram is worth the switch:**

* It's free (completely, you don't even pay with your privacy)
* It's secure (there's a [$200,000 prize](https://telegram.org/faq#q-how-secure-is-telegram) for the one who breaches its walls)
* It supports *Secret Chats* that are extra-secure with end-to-end encryption that ensures no message leaves your phone unencrypted (very useful for sending sensitive information over IM)
* **Multi-platform**, which means that you can continue your chats from your phone, laptop or a browser in any computer you may find, all synced through your phone number ([Webogram](http://zhukov.github.io/webogram/) is your in-browser Telegram clone)
* It's super **fast**, you have to use it to feel it
* It's built on a completely open protocol that is not XMPP
* It's not motivated by monetary motives at all
* It's cooler than WhatsApp
* **It's headquartered in Berlin and not in the US (I love this!)**

I seriously do not need any more reasons to make an instant switch to a much better service. Oh and Telegram is not owned by any social networks.

I and Shachi have moved all our messaging to Telegram. Will you too?
