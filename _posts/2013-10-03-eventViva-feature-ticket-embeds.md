title: "EventViva Feature: Ticket Embeds"
---

Now you can embed [EventViva](http://eventviva.com) tickets on your own website for sale. Just [create your event](http://eventviva.com/create) on EventViva and get your unique embed code for the event.

For clarity, check the image below. That is where your unique ticket embed code is located:
<figure class="minified">
	<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/embedcode.png">
	<figcaption>Unique ticket embed code</figcaption>
</figure>

And this is what your code will look like:
<figure class="minified">
	<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/embedcode2.png">
	<figcaption>The code you can embed on your own site</figcaption>
</figure>

### So from today, you can start embedding tickets to your events anywhere - on your own website, on your own web-portal or on your own ticket management system.

More cool features are going to get added to EventViva as and when we feel we are happy with them. But the ticket selling is surely going to get more exciting. We assure you that!
