title: "Moving out of spacebox"
---

This is it. I completed almost 2 years in the 16 square meter studio that I live in. Rental contract is over and it's time to pack.

Plenty of memories and moments spent in the house that will stay etched in mind. All in all, what was deemed to be a tough job to stay in such a small room turned out to be a pretty exciting time.

They don't call it a spacebox for no reason. It's a box on top of a box on top of a box. A completely portable housing structure that looks appalling from the outside. To tell you the truth, it was quite fun to live in (sarcasm?).

Well, it is time to move on and I finally leave my spacebox number 110 (although still in Delft).

Next post will be from the new house.
