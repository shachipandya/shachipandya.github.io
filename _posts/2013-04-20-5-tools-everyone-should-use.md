title: "5 tools everyone should use"
---

I have been meaning to share this for quite a while. I love cloud based solutions for stuff we did not have before and I love to leverage the immense power of Internet to simplify life.

I have a workflow setup for myself that is awfully detailed and highly customised but I can find common bits I can share that people can benefit from. Surprisingly many of these tools are still new to people! 

So here goes:

- [Evernote](http://evernote.com): a one-solution-fits-all kind of a service. [It's a note-taking service but much more than that](https://members.nerdgap.com/order-evernote-essentials/). I mostly save important tickets, passes and scanned documents in Evernote. I am currently writing my whole MSc thesis in Evernote. It's amazingly powerful at handling my image-laden documents, PDFs and also audio recordings of meetings. It's totally free to use and with iOS and Android apps. Alternative: [Simplenote](http://simplenote.com) 
- [Instapaper](http://instapaper.com): a solution to store anything you find on the Internet worth reading, but don't have the time for just now. You can toss it in your Instapaper queue with a click of a button and worry about it later. Free to use in browser with paid apps for iOS. A much more versatile solution is [Pocket](http://getpocket.com) (free everywhere) and I love that too. Alternative: [Springpad](http://springpad.com) 
- [Buffer](http://bufferapp.com): if you want to schedule your social media posts/updates in future, this is the best tool to use. You can set a time in advance and the post will go live at that time even if you are playing your weekend league match. It's free to use and it's awesome. Alternative: [HootSuite](http://hootsuite.com) 
- [CloudApp](http://getcloudapp.com): if ever you want to share small bits of information like screenshots, small PDF or a document, don't mail it. Just drag it to your CloudApp menubar widget and it will upload it (on their server), create a short link and copy it to your clipboard (all automatically). All you have to do is to send that link and you are done. Recipient will get the file in a matter of seconds. It's totally free to use. Alternative: [Droplr](http://droplr.com) 
- [BackBlaze](http://backblaze.com): automatically backup your whole computer in background. I cannot stress enough about how important this service is. It backs up your Dropbox folder and any number of external harddrives you have (you can store as much data as you want). It's $5/month and totally worth it. Alternative: [CrashPlan](http://crashplan.com) 

There are plenty of services ([Dropbox](http://dropbox.com), [Pinboard](http://pinboard.in), [FastMail](http://fastmail.fm) etc) and many more get added everyday that you can leverage to make life easy. Cloud makes it possible. 

Welcome to cloud based web!
