We hate the arrogant folks. They are judgmental and often derogatory. I am all for ignoring them at will. But at times, they deserve a response, so there is a way to do that by emanating positivity (for yourself) and a pinch of confidence.

It fills us with confidence and keeps our feet on ground. Read the detailed article [here](http://inoveryourhead.net/how-to-deal-with-arrogant-people/).

[In Over Your Head](http://inoveryourhead.net/best/) is an excellent web resource for developing a very electric personality and building a character. I personally recommend the site and their articles.
