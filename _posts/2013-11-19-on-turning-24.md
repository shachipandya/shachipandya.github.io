title: "On Turning 24"
---

It has a nice ring to it, 24! A number I have always loved. 

Another year passed by and an attempt of calling myself 24 when someone asks, begins. The feeling of being 'old' slowly starts to sink in even though the instinct and the heart cry out a loud 'no'. 

So the past year of my life has brought some of the most inquisitive moments that made me think about life as a whole at a very different level and from a very different perspective. Most of my year was spent in the Netherlands and it gave me a chance to think and analyse my life, goals and career. Isolation is indeed a great medicine to the thought-rush that is common at this age and I highly recommend it. It gives yourself time to think with a chit to not overdo it.

But more than anything else, I enjoyed the hell out of the whole year. Amazing memories were lived with some of the most awesome friends that I am quite lucky to have. I managed to travel to 3 new countries in the past year and that in itself should be considered quite a satisfactory outcome. And of course, I spent the most amazing time with the better half of mine - Shachi. 

Today morning, as I got out of bed in my apartment, my mother wished me with the same broad smile that she did when I was 12, 15, 18 and 21. **That smile is actually how I remember all my birthdays!** A mom's love never changes. It's there at the beginning of the day and it's there at the end of the day when you come back exhausted from work.

Personal new year resolution? I would get angry less. If possible, almost never. Well, these resolutions are easy to declare and hell of a lot harder to stay truthful to! But I will try. At least that will lead to a betterment.

A short trip down the memory lane -

As they say, it takes a lot to stay young even when your age says otherwise. I for sure don't plan to grow old. 

Here's to life and here's to youth!
