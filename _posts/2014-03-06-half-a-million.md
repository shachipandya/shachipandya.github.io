Rummaging through my old YouTube channel, I found a video that I had shared more than a couple of years ago. 

For preparation of the TEDxDelft in 2011, I met the Dutch creator and creative genius [Theo Jansen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theo_Jansen) as an enthusiast to help him out on a weekend to setup and trial out his strandbeests. He builds 'animals' out of PVC pipes and makes them move with his very own engineering feat and before that meeting, I had only read one or two articles about him.

When I met him that day, he offered us coffee and a warm stay at the beach near The Hague where he lives. I personally got to talk to him about how he makes these creatures.

He single-handedly creates these strandbeests capable of running autonomously (with a trigger of course). Why you must ask? **For fun**. Check out the [BBC's documentation](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSKyHmjyrkA) of Theo Jansen's work.

Here's the video I took of him setting one of his creations to a start:

It's gotten close to 500,000 views and I'm very happy to share it here so more of you can take a look at what he builds. 

[Here's the link to his TED talk](http://www.ted.com/talks/theo_jansen_creates_new_creatures) which, to this day, remains one of the best TED talks in the history of TED.

Here's 2011 me with Theo!
