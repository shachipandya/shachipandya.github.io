title: "Your startup is crap"
---

Entrepreneurship is awfully glorified by the masse in recent times. Everywhere we read, it's increasingly seeming like it has only come down to buying a stupid domain name and calling yourself one. Seriously, becoming an entrepreneur is not that simple, at least not when you actually want to bring a change.

Even the startups are shit these days. Yes, I call them [shit outright](http://www.badstartupidea.com/); utter crap even. Does the world really need another photo sharing service? Are people really going to adopt your "groundbreaking" way of "connecting" with each other? Do we really need to have another "revolutionising" app for texting each other? Not really. Read [this excellent recent article by Nick Bilton](http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/12/07/hundreds-of-start-ups-hope-to-be-a-copycat-start-up) of the New York Times. He has summarized very nicely what he feels about the innovation in startups these days. He has given the first-hand account of what is happening in the Valley and how even there, the situation is no different in terms of 'seriousness' in starting businesses.

I receive a lot of messages from friends and from friends of friends about their "startups" and 'ideas'. Most of them are really half-baked and not properly thought-through. I accept that there in nothing wrong in having ideas and sharing them but really, that is what they are -- ideas. Most of them are not capable (read *feasible*) of becoming successful as standalone businesses and it's foolish to expect them to do so.

>The real disruption, the real revolution, the real ground-breaking innovation happens when you think outside the ridiculously overrated "social" bubble; when you really think about **solving a problem.** 'Social' is not a problem and your app is shit. Go do something worthwhile. 

In recent times, I have seen some really awesome startups rising to fame; startups that are actually redefining the whole industry - the whole niche. For example, [Uber](http://uber.com) is completely changing the way we rent cabs and pay for them. They have solved the problem of inconvenience of having to pay by cash and the inconvenience caused by the uncertainty of arrival of the cab. *This is a real fucking problem and they have solved it.*

Another one is [23andMe](https://www.23andme.com/). They analyse your saliva sample that you send to them using their kit and provide valuable information about your body, disease-history and ancestry by processing your DNA. This is what *providing value* means. This is called *innovation.*

Companies like [FitBit](http://fitbit.com) and [Jawbone](http://jawbone.com) have actually defined a new space of market termed as the Quantified Self by building fitness related products to track your daily routine in every possible way. This is innovation. This is value to society.

[Robinhood](http://robinhood.io) is a startup that aims to remove the brokerage and frustration that comes with it in stock-trading. It aims to bring stock-trading to your computer within your own control. This is redefining an industry. They surely have faced more challenges setting these things up with the financial bureaucracy than some stupid *Instagram clone for dogs.*

Startups and entrepreneurship mean that you redefine the game and not fool the crowd. Nobody will use your stupid social network experience for the dogs of overly touchy prom-teens. We have enough. Social is not a category of research and innovation anymore. Seriously, go do something else.

More importantly, solve *real* problems and for God's sake, call yourself anything but an 'entrepreneur'. That word has lost all the meaning.

Maybe call yourself a 'maker'.
