title: "Innovation is scary"
---

Every industry is moving (read *progressing*) in terms of technical advancements. Some move slow while the others move fast. Now imagine a growing industry as a vehicle traveling on a highway. Real game-changing innovation in this scenario is like a speed-breaker. It allows time to the industry to slow down and get a perspective. I say this because whenever innovation hits the industry, it hits everyone associated with that industry and the vehicle as a whole is slowed down momentarily to comprehend the repercussions and ramifications of the wave of innovation. As a vehicle slows down, an opportunity arises to change the direction of its motion (*growth* of the market). The same way, when innovation hits the market, it’s an opportunity to change the future of the industry. Innovation is **needed**.


It’s a classic case of the **needs** and **wants**. The industry does not **want** to change but it needs to **change**. Things can always improve no matter what. And that is what innovation strives to bring. That is why innovation is hard, scary and whatever other daunting adjectives you can throw in. It’s because industry is people and your work affects everyone. Innovation needs acknowledgement. 

When you build something, you try to do it your way. You try to make it better and break the rules that constrained product design within that industry. You put your work out there. There is a risk people might completely hate what you made. You can be called ‘novices’ and someone who doesn’t really ‘understand’ the needs of the industry. That happens. And that is scary.

Innovation takes skills, market-knowledge, practice and persistence. But more importantly, innovation takes **courage**. It takes guts to stand up with your product and be laughed at by incumbents; and still be wanting to say you created it. 

The most important thing is to **dare**; to show that you can stand by your creation and dust off the near-sighted criticism to present the bigger picture. 

**Because innovation is the easiest route to success and recognition; and also the toughest.**
