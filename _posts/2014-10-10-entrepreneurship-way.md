Recently, I and Aditya ([@adityapatadia](http://twitter.com/adityapatadia)) gave a talk about entrepreneurship and taking it up as an alternative career approach. We covered topics like difficulties in establishing your own thing, taking control of your career, facing new daunting projects and learning exciting new skills.

Inspiring young minds to acquire meaningful and forward-thinking skills is a very natural progression of the work we do at [Octal](http://theoctal.com). We plan to do more workshops and talks in the future.
