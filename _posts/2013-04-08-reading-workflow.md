title: "Reading workflow"

The key to good writing is a lot of reading. Reading has become entirely electronic and digital nowadays. Personally I don't find anything wrong with it because carrying my ebooks with me on a travel is a much better prospect that beats physically carrying a book any day. ​

I have built up a workflow to read and consume content online. I am sharing my reading workflow today. A lot of the tools I use are free and some are paid. Either way, building a workflow is a matter of choice personal preferences. 

There are 3 components to my online/digital reading workflow. First is to find stuff: I do it via blog RSS feeds that I follow. This usually happens in the [Reeder app (iOS)](http://reederapp.com) on all my devices. Now that Google Reader is defunct, I will have to move my feed syncing to Fever or [Feedbin.me](http://feedbin.me) but that is for later. If I can't read my feeds right now, Reeder also lets me send interesting articles to Instapaper (next topic) for later reading.

Second is ​to temporarily store articles that I want to read. There are 2 services that handle this pretty well. [Pocket](http://getpocket.com) and [Instapaper](http://instapaper.com). They have bookmarklets for all popular browsers from where you can save any page with just a single click and send the article to your reading queue. This works perfectly because it's not always that I find myself in a position to read something instantly. If I am busy doing something else, I will just push that article to my reading queue on Instapaper (my preference) and read it when I get time. This gives me a peace of mind that the article I want to read (but don't have time for, right now) is safely saved for later. By the way, both Pocket and Instapaper have iOS apps and Android clients and hence articles can be read on mobile devices as well. Both of them also offer a clean (stripped down) version of your article (on their web interface) that lets you read without the advertisements and other noisy stuff around the main content. Did I mention both services (not apps) are totally free? 

Third part of my reading workflow is to save articles/essays permanently for good. If I find a piece of article so good that I might want to refer in future, I will permanently bookmark it using [Pinboard](http://pinboard.in).​ Pinboard (a bookmarking service) lets you bookmark anything on the web using tags so you can refer to relevant content later. There is no limit on number of bookmarks you can save and tags you can use. Instapaper and Reeder both give options to save articles to Pinboard forever right from within their apps. Pinboard is not free but with a one-time fee, you can get in and keep using it for life. I love the service and I already have a huge pool of bookmarks tagged and saved there. 

So this makes my reading workflow complete. It starts on a random web page/RSS feed or a link I found on Twitter/App.net, goes to Instapaper for a better reading pleasure and ends up in Pinboard if I like it and want to save it forever. ​

I hope this helps build up your own workflow. Keep reading!​
