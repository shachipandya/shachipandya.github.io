title: "BeagleBone: The unsung powerhouse"
---

So I made projects and products from Arduino (the low end microcontroller-based computer for hobby electronics and projects) for 5+ years. For the last few months, I was thinking about expanding my skill-set and learning something new. Something that would enhance the capabilities of such electronic boards to much more than what Arduino provides. 

I have a few leads in the industry like a few people from the amazing MakerBot Industries and the [MAKEzine](http://makezine.com/). People like [Matt Richardson](http://twitter.com/mattrichardson), [Rob Faludi](http://twitter.com/faludi) and [David Mellis](http://twitter.com/mellis) constantly pitch new products and such tools that empower today's engineers.

Matt himself wrote an introductory book recently on the great new BeagleBone from [BeagleBoard](http://beagleboard.org/). He was kind enough to let me have a copy of the book pretty early and I am already into it. The book itself is a work of great detail and patience.

And here is the amazing BeagleBone Black.

It boasts of very lofty specifications compared to the other controller-based boards like the Arduino. And that is exactly what I was going for with the will to upgrade. It can boot Linux in under 10 seconds and can have all the core functionality a full-fledged operating system offers. It also has a built-in **Python** and **JavaScript** support that I often require for small tasks. **More than anything else, I was looking for a more powerful 'computer' than a 'controller' (one that could only execute lines of code sequentially).** BeagleBone Black is neat!

I ordered mine from Adafruit yesterday and should be getting it by tomorrow. I will write more on development on the BeagleBone once I start playing with it. I have a few products already in mind.

If you fancy getting started just like I do, [head over here](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920028116.do) and get Matt's book. It's worth every penny.

More soon.
