title: "What you don't know"
---

This is something I wanted to write about for a long time. My articles get geeky at times and I risk losing a generic audience as a result. But you know what? I really don't care. I think it's the best time in the history of mankind to be a geek. It really is and that is why if you are not a geek, you are not interesting!

Why I say this? Recently, I read in an Internet magazine that a pair of 16 year old boys launched an app on the App Store and made a fortune. It may seem like an overnight turn of events for those reading the story but it was surely a caffeine driven months long coding spree for the boys. The point is, the boys only had a couple of laptops and an Internet connection, but all the more, a desire to do something. And to be frank, that's all it takes! 

I think we all are so lucky to be living in this time, this era right now that we can never be thankful enough. We have every single thing we need to be successful. And I say that if someone is unsuccessful and miserable in today's world, with the amount of opportunities at helm, he is just stupid and it's only his damn fault.

I had this realisation listening to a speech given by Gary Vaynerchuk (another one of those web honchos but definitely an impressive one).

In his own words, 'The Internet was born in the 90s, it's barely 16, it surely did not even have sex yet and still it's dominating us!'

Go out there and do it! Get your bite of success before you lose your appetite.
