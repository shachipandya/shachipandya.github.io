title: "P vs NP"
---

I am sure you have heard of this. No matter what specialisation you studied/majored in, you have at least had a little interaction with this. This problem (or rather a research topic) has been a hotpot since the inception of computation theory and algorithmic problem solving. Here in this blog post, I would like to offer a simple explanation of what this fuss is all about and what lies ahead of us in computation world as a challenge. I admit that the article is a bit long but I encourage you to read it. It just might be worth it.

The P vs NP problem and the discussion around it can be daunting and too narrow (only revolving around computer science). It may seem irrelevant for someone from an arts or a physics background. But in reality, P vs NP problem has to do with all the branches of science that deal with computation. That practically covers almost all of science. It is relevant where computation occurs. And computation occurs everywhere. Be it in nature (flower petal patterns and patterns of sea-shells), in physics (revolutions of planets), in biology (division of cells) and everywhere. How do we perform computation? How does nature perform computation? Using an algorithm of course.

So let us begin. First, we need to know what algorithms are. An algorithm is a process: from adding two numbers to find the addition, sequentially adding the numbers to find the multiplication of two numbers and so on. It's a collection of accurate steps to find a solution of a problem. Now the question is, 'Is it possible to find an algorithm for everything?' The answer is not simple. And the quest of the answer for this is the P vs NP problem. It's that simple (at least the description is)! 

There are two type of problems in the world.
1) Those we can find solutions of (efficiently).
2) Those we can verify (efficiently) after the solution is known.
In the first case, the algorithm of finding the answers is not complex. It's computationally feasible to find the solutions of the problem and do so in finite time. Are there better algorithms to find solutions of these problems? Maybe. But we do not concern ourselves for now with those as long as we have one algorithm that is capable of solving the problem. These problems make the class P. In short, class P has all the problems that are solvable - in finite time using algorithms. Simple as that. Some examples can be: pattern matching, finding the shortest path, Fourier transforms, multiplication and addition etc. This is the solvable side of the universe. 

But that is not where the story ends. Not all the problems are easily solvable because if they were, there would not be much of an issue! So there are other kinds of problems. Imagine a Sudoku puzzle. Or finding the factors of 143,335,235,764,296 (any large number for example). These problems are not easy to solve. There does not exist an easy (mark the world) algorithm which is capable of solving these problems. BUT, the important thing to note here is that once you have a solution of these problems, it's trivial to verify if that solution is true or not. Verification algorithm is a fairly simple one. So all the problems that have efficient and simple algorithms to verify their solutions (but not find the solutions) make the class NP. These are the interesting ones! 

So basically: Finding solutions is much harder than verifying them.

We as humans, encounter NP problems almost everyday in life. Problems from common fields of study fall in this category as well. For example, 

Mathematicians: have a statement, finding the proof
Scientists: given experimental data, find a theory to explain it
Engineers: given constraints (size, weight, energy), find (build) a design
What is common in these challenges? Checking the solution (once found) is an easy task. Because how would you look for something when you can't tell when you have found it! 

There are two types of NP problems (subsets of NP):
	1) NP-complete
	2) NP-incomplete
Let us assume we found an algorithm to solve the Sudoku puzzle. Is that algorithm any good for something other than solving puzzles? Yes! That algorithm can also be applied to other NP problems and it can solve other problems in this category. This algorithm can be applied to solve the theorems, it can be applied to find the factors of very large numbers and so on. This means if any problem in the set NP is as hard as any other in the set, it belongs to the subset NP-complete. It means that if there is a solution to one NP-complete problem, there is a solution to all of them. And hence they become solvable (which is the property of the set P) which leads to P being the same as NP (P = NP). In other words, if the Sudoku algorithm is found, than under that assumption, P = NP is valid.

But what about the other class of NP problems? The class where the correlation does not hold true? We are talking about the set in which finding a solution to one problem does not lead to a solution of other problems in the set. This subset of NP is called the NP-incomplete. The problem of factorizing large integers falls in this category. Meaning that finding an algorithm for large number's factors does not necessarily lead to solutions of other problems in this set.

Under these lines of thoughts so far, we can say that for now, P â‰  NP since we cannot find solutions to the NP-complete problems (yet). If we draw a concise final picture of how the whole set of problems looks, it would appear something like this:

The drawing is of course fairly primitive and for a pictorial understanding. It only worries about the solvable problems for now. The actual computation theory has far more complex genres of solutions and themes of problems. But this was a (admittedly long) basic understanding of the P vs NP problem.

I highly recommend checking [this video from professor Avi Wigderson](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTeZP-XfuKI). It is very informative and really simple to understand. Of course, things must always be made simple to understand!
