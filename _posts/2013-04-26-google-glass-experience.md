title: "Google Glass experience"
---

So here I am at The Next Web Conference in Amsterdam. Going for some lunch after the keynotes and guess who I see at the corner table? Robert Scoble aka the [Scobleizer](http://twitter.com/scobleizer).  He needs no introduction in the tech community but still for the not-so-geek types, he is a motivator, advisor and an investor in startup companies as well as giants like Facebook, Twitter and Microsoft.

So, I walk up to him (he is busy with his lemon tea) and introduce myself. Not at all disturbed by my interruption, he gets up, shakes my hand and starts talking.  

> Hello Mr Scoble, I noticed the Glass from way over there on the other side of the restaurant.  

And he laughs (he probably gets that a lot). What followed was an epic 15 minutes discussion including a demo of the Google Glass. He was more than willing to let me try the glasses on and it was fantastic. I took a couple of pictures ("Glass, take a picture") and found driving directions to the central station.

We went on to discuss how he got access to his Google Glass and how the experience has been. There are [comprehensive reviews out already](http://www.theverge.com/2013/2/22/4013406/i-used-google-glass-its-the-future-with-monthly-updates) for more information.

The academy class with Werner Vogels was another highlight of the conference. His explanation of how Amazon runs its cloud services and how they manage the tech behind it was clear and classy (I can provide the class notes at request). He is surely one of the smartest people I have met.

This conference has been absolutely amazing. I have had a chance to meet so many great people over the course of last 48 hours, including Willem-Alexander (the King of The Netherlands), Werner Vogels (CTO and Vice President of Amazon.com), Boris and Patrick (founders of TNW), Stephen Wolfram (founder of Wolfram Research) and Tim Ferriss (author, entrepreneur, investor and advisor).  

Feeling lucky and overwhelmed. This inspiration will carry on.
