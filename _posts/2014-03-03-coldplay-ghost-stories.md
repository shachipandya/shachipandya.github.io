title: "Coldplay announce Ghost Stories"

Normally I don't write much about something other than tech. But this is Coldplay and they are special to me and to millions others around the world.

They have announced a new album **Ghost Stories**, out on May 19th this summer.

The track **Magic** is available for download and the [whole album can be pre-ordered](https://itunes.apple.com/in/album/ghost-stories/id829909653) (already done!) on iTunes.

Love the artwork of the album. The summer just got special.
