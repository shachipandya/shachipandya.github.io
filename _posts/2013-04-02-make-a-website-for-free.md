title: "Make a website for free"

I deferred posting this article to April 2nd (today) since otherwise the title had all the makings for being considered an April Fool hoax! â€‹

There are plenty of tools for you to start your own website, most of which are drag and drop type. I used one of that kind in past and was frustrated at the sluggish nature of the website. Making a website is not that hard but making a good, robust website is the essential thing. By good I mean well structured and simple by function and design. The best website for you is the one you handcraft yourself. Following this article, you can learn to do so. 

The tool I suggest to build websites with, is called Jekyll. [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) lets you create awesome static sites within minutes (yes, literally minutes) and host them on [GitHub](http://github.com) for free. Static sites are websites that require minimal server-side activity and mostly have static content. Blogs are a good example of such static sites. Most personal websites nowadays are static websites using one tool or the other. Jekyll is widely used and loved on the web. 

When you use Jekyll, all you have to create your website is to write all your content using basic [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and that's it. Jekyll will convert those text files to a web-presentable HTML and also wrap it around the CSS (your website styling) that you apply. Thus you have all the liberty to customize the website any way you want. You can add/replace and modify all the pages and you can have complete control of what is posted.

Advantages of having a static website are apparent: 

* they are fast because none of your code runs on the web-server
* modifying your website is a breeze (you can do everything in your local website folder on your computer)
* changes go live instantly
* hosting via GitHub is totally free
* you can use your custom domain
* content is saved locally so no risk of losing it at once

Of course there are some disadvantages. But there are clever workarounds for you as well to dodge them. Like you cannot have dynamic components like blog comments but you can handle them via third-party clients like [Disqus](http://disqus.com). Barring stuff like that, for rendering simple website landing pages and blogs, Jekyll is a powerhouse.

Want to get started with a Jekyll website? Below are the best tutorials I could find. I followed them personally so they are highly recommended (there are probably a 100 ways to do this, but I recommend the ones below):

* [Way 1](http://chrislunsford.com/starting-a-new-blog-with-jekyll-and-github.html)
* [Way 2](http://www.ksornberger.com/blog/blogging-with-jekyll-and-github/)

You only need to follow one of them. Also, keep your Terminal and basic coding skills handy. Once you are through the tutorial, fork someone's git repo from [this list](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/Sites) and modify the design according to your needs (thus, you don't have to build your blog from scratch). Don't forget to cite the source! 

There are plenty of amazing website designs built upon Jekyll out there like the sites of [Brett Terpstra](http://brettterpstra.com), [Tom Ward](http://tomafro.net) and [Patrick Welker](http://rocketink.net) (these are also some of the inspiring people I follow). 

The combination of Jekyll + GitHub is really hot right now because it's completely free and insanely customisable. This website itself is built using Jekyll. 

Also, I recently discovered the work of [Aniket Pant](http://aniketpant.com), who is a coder, speaker and a developer. He has handcoded his website and it's surely a piece of art. Lovely design! 

So go out there and get yourself a website!
