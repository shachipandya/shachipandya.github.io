title: "Why I write"
---

I started blogging from my early college days which was way back in 2008. Back then, it was mostly about trying to get used to the blogosphere and technical knowhow. I did not realise or even care about the larger implications of blogging. I just wanted to write.

Just like in those days, even today, almost every week, I get asked the same question: 'Why do you invest so much time, energy and efforts in maintaining a website/blog?' I have several reasons and I really feel that I should put them out here (to motivate even me if some day I don't feel like writing).

First reason is, I think blogging has really helped me start reading a lot. I pick up anything and everything to read almost everyday. It has helped me become a better thinker. I have a clearer perspective on life now than I used to have a few years back.

Secondly, blogging has helped me become a better writer (compared to my own self from 5 years ago). It helps me put my thoughts in words in a cohesive and succinct manner. I became more aware about my writing knowing that its not just me who reads it now! 

Thirdly, a blog converts your identity into a brand. The content you write gains a sense of authenticity and that is why blogging instills a mild sense of achievement as every blog post goes out there in the Internet ocean. It stays there and has its own little space. The beauty of this is that you don't need every single person on the earth to read it. You just need the right one. And as long as he/she or they do, I am happy. 

So, for me, I will spend 2-3-4 hours a week on my website and write things that I care about and I think about. Because it's worth it!
