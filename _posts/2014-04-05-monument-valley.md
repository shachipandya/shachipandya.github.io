I learned about this [epic game](http://www.monumentvalleygame.com) from a few people I follow on Twitter. 

I showed it to Shachi today and she finished it by night. It's the first ever game on iOS that has enticed Shachi so much that she actually stayed on for 3 hours to finish it on pretty much a single sitting.

It's not really surprising. This is truly a special game. It's a puzzle with a cool storyline - take the princess along a journey towards her destiny while solving visually awesome puzzles along the way. The visuals and the theme setup of the game are stunning. I have not seen a game built with so much patience and attention to detail. 

Without praising it much in words, I'm sharing some of the screenshots I took while Shachi was playing (well, she took most of them).

Here's the App Store link for downloading the game: [Download here](https://itunes.apple.com/in/app/monument-valley/id728293409?mt=8).

> The movements, physics and the dynamics in the game feel almost hypnotic.

If you're on iOS, this is definitely worth the $3.99.
