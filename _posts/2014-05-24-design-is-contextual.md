title: "Want to learn to design? Understand Context"

Terrible title, but allow me to explain.

Context means awareness of the surroundings you are putting your design into. Context is awareness about the person you are designing for. Context is being truthful to what is required out of your design.

Everything is contextual.

An interface you design for an open social network (e.g. Facebook) will not be the same if you design an interface for a limited social network for a company (e.g. SalesForce). 

That is the reason you must always go to the thinking phase before starting to design anything. You must be thorough with the context-space of the product and you should be designing within that.

* What is required
* How it is required
* Who would be using the design
* What's his skill-level

This is why getting in the mindset of your user is important. That shows that you *care* for your user.

> BE the person who will use your design.

Get as much information as you can about *that* person and *then* start designing.

We work so hard at [Octal](http://theoctal.com) to implement these rules thoroughly in things we design. An incorrect button-size in our interface means sleepless nights for us. It doesn't have to be perfect, nothing actually is. But it has to exhibit that you as a designer *care* and pay attention to the <u>*little details*</u>.

And that only happens when you understand the **context.**
