title: "Quantified-self data is beautiful, acquisition is painful"
---

I have been an admirer of acquiring data about day-to-day life and activities. Knowing what I do with my day and how much my body goes through each day is a good way to quantify my life.

But there's an interesting conundrum: **Measuring life results in you affecting your living process.** There's an interesting correlation in the Quantum Physics along the same lines called the [Observer Effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_effect_%28physics%29). When you actively take part in measuring something about your daily life, you are changing your daily life (even if it's very minimal).

This leads to a major friction in the process of measurement. Most people do not want to do this since it's cumbersome. It's cumbersome to consciously record aspects of your life in order to build up the data. And sadly, technology falls short miserably (and not surprisingly) to automate this.

> Acquiring data about life should be autonomous and that clearly isn't within the reach of tech at the moment.

## There are smartphones

There are a lot of advancements happening in the tech-world though, in this field. Most of them are built on top of the already existing piece of tech with people nowadays - their smartphones. The data these phones are capable to acquire are of different formats but with limited flavours because of the sensors the manufacturers can embed. Acceleration, audio (microphone) and visual (camera) are different (and perhaps the only) kinds of inputs these phones can record. It's limited at the moment but the limits are expanding quickly.

## Then there is a different class of devices

Devices like [FitBit](http://fitbit.com), [Jawbone UP](http://jawbone.com/up) are popular because they get out of the way (I have used both). No user input is required. They are normally pretty good at recording the movement data that is tightly integrated with the movement of your body. Some of them also provide facilities to record your food and calorie intake. But these extra features get used very rarely because those data-points are not recorded autonomously. Nobody likes to enter/note-down what they eat 4 times a day. 

> There's the problem: do you care enough to acquire the data to painstakingly record/write it manually everyday?

### The case of the Reporter app

Recently I tried [Reporter app](http://www.reporter-app.com/) by [Nicholas Felton](http://feltron.com/) who is a data-nerd himself. It requires/allows you to configure questions you want to be asked everyday on fixed intervals about your life and your activities. It will record answers and provide you the results in nice infographics within the app.

For a while it was fun. Eventually it became an exercise and then it became a burden: I don't want to be pastered 10 times a day to be asked about what I am doing. Just record what you can autonomously and don't bother me.

### The problem with such apps

Reporter app is really good at what it does (acquiring tedious data) but it suffers from the same problem about quantified-self: there's no autonomy. You manually enter data. That's boring. That's an added friction and a reason for me to rather NOT record the data. Read a detailed review of that process by [Shawn Blanc](http://shawnblanc.net/2014/03/reporter-day-one-and-launch-center-pro/).

Other aspect of this is the generalization (and hence the reliability) of this data. Reporter app pings you *N* number of times a day to ask for data. They are equally separated in time (barring the sleep-time). *But if you postpone or delay entering the data, you have already displaced the sampling point from where it should be for ideal measurement*. This is **non-trivial** since it means that you only enter data when you are available and hence you do not have a good measure of what your life is about when you are busy (since the busy part of your day does not have a lot of data-points to work with).

**Here's where Reporter app gets it wrong (or, not entirely right)**: as depicted [here](http://bygonebureau.com/2014/03/10/me-my-quantified-self-and-i/), the data it aims to gather is surely not the most important aspect you would want to measure and quantify. At least it's not that significant. Mostly this is because of the limitations iOS forces on the app developers and the amount of data they can play with. It's very difficult to acquire data about who we photograph, who we call the most and with whom we talk most of the time while staying within the boundaries enforced by mobile OSs like iOS. An App is simply not enough for intricate analysis like this. 

### We are making progress

But of course, an app is as close as we can get to a reliable method of accruing data at the moment since the smartphones are the most closely-kept sensors on our body to do this stuff. Reporter app is a very good attempt and I admire the efforts of Felton. More tools like that should exist in order for the data-acquisition process to evolve.

The current toolset to craft quantified-self is not ideal and is surely not accurate enough but we are definitely making inroads to this wonderful world of data. After all, we have [Stephen Wolfram](http://blog.stephenwolfram.com/2013/03/talking-about-the-computational-future-at-sxsw-2013/) (that talk changed the way I view data). Give it a go.
