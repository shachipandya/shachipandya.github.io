title: "Under the Alpine sun"

You are walking on the side of a hill on a wet paved road with faint rings of the famous Swiss bells serenading your ears. Clouds floating around head-high with a cool breeze ruffling your hair and you see a farmer clinking out cheese on the hillside wooden cottage with a couple of patchy skinned cows wandering in the yard. And you realize you are in the most romantic part of Europe! 

The week spent in Switzerland, in Interlaken and surrounding villages to be precise, was by far one of the most refreshing experiences throughout my stay here in Europe. I have had an opportunity to interact with the locals, roam around some unusual places and click some amazing pictures. The highlight of the trip of course was the visit to the top-most railway station of Europe, the Jungfraujoch. It's situated at a staggering 11,333 ft from the sea level (I would not say that seeing a Rolex watch worth 72,000 Franks was the highlight of the trip). Quite an experience it was.

The weather was very lenient on the day we visited Jungfrau and even on the subsequent days. That made for a very relaxing experience.

To sum it up, only in Europe can I expect such exhilarating week-long getaways combining cultural and exotic experiences. I surely hope to do more of these.

Of course a trip is not complete without a souvenir. I got myself an engraved [classic Victorinox Swiss army knife](http://www.victorinox.com/ch/product/Swiss-Army-Knives/Category/Classic/Classic-Range-58-mm/Classic/0.6223 "classic Victorinox Swiss army knife") in lush white. Masterpiece!
