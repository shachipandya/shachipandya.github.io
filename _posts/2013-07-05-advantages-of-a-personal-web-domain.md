title: "Advantages of a personal web domain"
---

There are a lot of them (domains and advantages). Maybe more than those I will list out here. But as a 23 year old grad student, these emerge to me that are obvious if you already have a domain that you are actively using. 

- Amazingly advantageous in the recruitment process if you have a simple landing page set up at the domain (Tumblr allows this for free). First thing recruiters nowadays do is to Google your name when they review your information.
- Extra brownie points if you rank first in Google for your name (this is also an advantage once you have a domain). The reason is that they want to know if you are worth Googling for! Depending on your name, this can be easy or difficult. An advice: tie up your domain with your Google+ profile. That helps in climbing up to number one. 
- Having a domain makes the email address very portable. For example, when you have an email address as __firstname@yourname.com__ (or something personal), it becomes easy to migrate the backend email service without changing your email address (so you can migrate your email service from Gmail to Outlook and your 800+ contacts do not need to be notified of it because your address does not change). Outlook provides custom domain based email for free. Gmail is now paid in that regard.
- A personal domain (no matter how easy it has become to buy one), is still a commodity that is highly underrated. In the world where 'If you are not on the web, you don't exist' is quickly becoming the mantra, there are no excuses for not having a domain of your own. This can set you apart from others (and some people still do not understand this).
- It shows how sincere you are about your online identity.  
It helps you get noticed. You have to be present on the web. And a Facebook profile is not the way to do that. 
- Having a personal landing page tied with your domain remains online all the time and hence there is a serendipitous chance that someone important might just notice you and your work and it might change your life.
- When you tie your online islands (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Quora and even your resume) to your personal domain, it becomes a single entry-point to give out. When you want to let someone know how to contact you, you can just give them your domain address and that makes the whole process unbelievably easy (even more so on a telephone).
- The immense sense of pride. Yes.  

Of course not having a domain is not going to actively hurt you but having one will benefit for sure. Plus, it's only about $5 to $10 a year which can end up becoming a worthwhile investment. 

Thinking about getting one? You should! [This](http://hover.com) is one place to start.
