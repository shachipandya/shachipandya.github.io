title: "Privacy d'oh"
---

We are living in a world where the word the word 'privacy' bears no value. At least to the social media fanatics who want to put everything from the food they had today to the real-time Twitter feed having up to date information of what they are doing. And when the moment comes, we have the same people crying over the privacy and copyright issues. 

Let us imagine a scenario: consider you have a friend in a new town. You are looking for a place when you arrive in this new town and you are going to trash your stuff in his house in the meantime. Once done, you don't show up to take your stuff back. He sells your stuff and makes money from it. When you come to know about it, you get super mad and start to fight about why he did so when he did not own the stuff! (That's where you are wrong, read on) Nothing explains it better than an XKCD strip:

This is what happens with social media (well, at least to the free part of social media). You publish your content on their platform (like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Pinterest, Tumblr etc) and it stays there. They let you do this for free. They use/consume their own resources at their expense to keep your stuff present on the web. They might sell your stuff and they have every right to make money from it too. Because the moment you put content on their platform, it's not yours anymore! It belongs to them because they keep it there. And anyway, they never came knocking on your door to invite you to post on their website! It was your choice to do so and hence you must not cry foul when things go awry.

If you are so concerned about the ownership of your content, ditch the free social media and go for a customer/user centric social media platforms like App.net and others. There aren't many but hey, if you are serious about privacy and content ownership, you have to be selective on choosing the right platform.

Because somebody has to pay for the services/resources and I would advise that it is rather you than the advertisers (like in the case of free platforms).
