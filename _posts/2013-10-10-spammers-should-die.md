Today's Pastry Box edition presents a thought from the coveted Chris Coyier.

He started CodePen - the in-browser HTML, CSS and JavaScript simulator and a code tester. As expected, an open and readily available service as his would receive a lot of spam. 

In his own words,

>When I’m particularly frustrated, I think about changing my opinion on the death penalty. This asshole is using my software, which I work so hard at making awesome, to cheat and steal from others.
>
>And not only are they trying to hurt others, they hurt me. Their spam puts CodePen at risk of Google thinking it’s a spam farm and displaying nasty warnings when people come there and removing us from search results. A devastating blow for any website.

He is absolutely right and you should read [the whole thing](http://the-pastry-box-project.net/chris-coyier/2013-october-10/). Any programmer and designer's time would be much better spent at building amazing things for people to use, than working on futile attempts to mitigate spammers.

My cofounder Aditya ([@AdityaPatadia](http://twitter.com/adityapatadia)) recently met a team member of [SlideShare](http://slideshare.net) (It's an online service to host your presentation slides). Aditya asked a question to him on similar lines about battling spam, to which he replied, 'About 85-90% presentation slides added to the database everyday are spams and we fight so hard to come up with algorithms to filter out such content'.

The problem is worse than we think. Tons of man-hours are wasted everyday that could be put to a much better use.
