And we didn't even know it did. Read that article.

Keeping accurate time is a very essential aspect of the Global Positioning System because that is the measurement used to determine accurate absolute position of objects receiving the GPS signal.

Accuracy required in keeping a time reference aboard the satellites is about 20-30 ns.

Read the article to know how the movements of the satellites relative to that of the earth itself are taken into account to counter its effects and come up at the required accuracy. In that, both the theories of relativity - [General](http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/~pogge/Ast162/Unit5/gr.html) and the [Special](http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/~pogge/Ast162/Unit5/sr.html) are taken into account.

We always wondered what use these theories were apart from being the epitome of complexity. Well, there we go.
