title: "Stephen Wolfram is awesome"
---

These recent weeks, I have been digging into Wolfram Research. Mainly because I wanted to see what the company is doing and how far they have come in the last 8 years. Wolfram's [Mathematica](http://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/) was the first programming tool I used in my highschool and I loved it. I wasn't very good at it since I was still learning what programming was and the syntax took a while to sink in. 

But when I checked out [Stephen Wolfram's blog](http://blog.stephenwolfram.com/) and followed some of his talks, I was awed. Literally. The engine Wolfram Alpha (released in 2009) has come a long way in 4 years. To be honest, it's the most [ingenius](http://www.wolframalpha.com/examples/) website based processing engine in the world. Wolfram Alpha is a web based natural language processing tool that returns answers based to whatever you query in it. Take '[whatever](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=am+i+drunk)' literally here. [In a talk Stephen gave in SXSW 2013, he demonstrated this on-stage](http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/29907143) to the audience what this engine is capable of. Some of the queries he put in the search-box were (click on them to see results): 

1) [Box office of Life of Pi vs Die Hard](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=life+of+pi+box+office+vs+die+hard&a=*DPClash.MovieP.box+office-_*DomesticDailyCumulativeBoxOfficeGross.dflt-&a=*DPClash.MovieE.die+hard-_*AGoodDayToDieHard2013DuneEntertainment-)

2) [John as a name](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=john+as+a+name)

These are just a few examples. He also showed that the engine is so robust it can handle image as inputs too. On providing an image as input, you can get its chromatic histogram, apply filter effects and run algorithms on the pixelleted data. How awesome is that! [Here is an extensive list of things](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/10-cool-wolfram-alpha-read-write-english-language/) you can do with Wolfram Alpha.

Wolfram Alpha provides all this for free as a web based engine. Stephen himself is one of the coolest geeks around. He started the company himself and has tested the algorithms in his own life for the last 25 years. He has a data-chunk worth those last 25 years about every single measurable aspect of his life: from emails he has processed in all those years and the places he has traveled to a more recent metric about his daily keystrokes on the keyboard, daily phone call distribution and the steps he takes on an average day. Not to forget the images from [Memoto](http://memoto.com) camera he logs/processes everyday.

He founded Wolfram Research and made Mathematica (and many more things) that I used as my first programming tool. I loved it and still use it occasionally. I strongly recommend his [SXSW talk](http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/29907143) which will blow your mind for sure.

A bow to Wolfram and his work. I am fortunate enough to meet him personally next week in a conference in Amsterdam.

Wolfram Research is a company that I would want to work for!
