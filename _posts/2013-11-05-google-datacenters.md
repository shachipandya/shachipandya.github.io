Recently, [one of my friends, Shreyas](http://shreyaspandya.com) mailed me the link to this article from XKCD's What If series.

Here are some tidbits that made me think I should share this with you.

>Google almost certainly has more data storage capacity than any other organisation on Earth.

True.

>Google's aggregate capital expenditures–spending on building stuff—adds up to somewhere over $12 billion dollars. Their biggest data-centres cost half a billion to a billion dollars, so they can't have more than 20 or so of those.

>In addition [to the main data-centres they mention on the website], they appear to operate a number of other large data-centres (sometimes through subsidiary corporations), including: 
1. Eemshaven, Netherlands
2. Groningen, Netherlands
3. Budapest, Hungary
4. Wrocław, Poland
5. Reston, Virginia
6. Additional sites near Atlanta, Georgia

I approve of this. I personally know from trusted sources about those sites in the Netherlands.

Talking about the NSA in comparison, they are building a new data-centre in Utah, reported to be able to hold up to a **yottabyte (= 1 trillion TBs)** of data. Yes, truly absurd. [Reports have later re-framed the whole claim](http://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2013/07/24/blueprints-of-nsa-data-center-in-utah-suggest-its-storage-capacity-is-less-impressive-than-thought/) but even exabytes is outrageous. But that is for the NSA to worry about.

Here comes the most interesting part:

>There are a lot of tricks for digging up information about Google's operations. Ironically, **many of them involve using Google itself**—from Googling for job postings in strange cities to using image search to find leaked cell camera photos of data-centre visits.

And,

>The easiest way to find manned Google data centres is to ask taxi drivers and **pizza delivery people.**

Wow.

>Google has created what might be the most sophisticated information-gathering apparatus in the history of the Earth... and the only people with information about them are the pizza delivery drivers.
>Who watches the watchers?
Apparently, Domino's.
