title: "365 days of engagement"
---
So it has come down to counting anniversaries. Today is our first. It was August 11, 2012 - the day I and Shachi got engaged. It has been nothing short of a thrill ride so far. Gaining kilograms of weight for no apparent reason is the first aftermath. It is after all really cool to become a son-in-law in India.

Shachi is a fashion designer and my first-rate curator. Most of my design work, content and photos get curated first by her (it's not as easy as you might think, most of my pictures at most get a 'meh'). That is quite fun and is recommended if you are in a similar situation. Life is good.

This 1 year has been absolutely amazing and if not for the date, I wouldn't have even realised that it has been that long already. Time flies. To all my friends who are not yet committed, I highly recommend it. 

Here's to many more anniversaries!
