title: "My Jekyll-site Publishing Workflow"
---

So after moving to the right way of blogging and maintaining a website, I now have a little time on hand to share the workflow of how I manage this website.

When I moved to Jekyll, first important thing it allowed me to do was to have more freedom and control of modifying the design, content and layout of the website. That was actually the whole point of migrating away from Squarespace. After I made the move, I also [found quite a few tirades](http://unretrofied.com/blog/2013/8/25/my-squarespace-6-wish-list) in the direction of Squarespace from other bloggers I follow. But anyway, enough about the past.

So now I have [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) set up. The tools I use to publish to this website and tinker with the source code are listed below.

* [ForkLift](http://www.binarynights.com/) - the best **FTP client** for my needs. It's capable of connecting (and staying connected) to my **Amazon S3** bucket for this website. The transfer of files is a breeze. It takes a lot of pain away from frequent website updates (the small changes I constantly keep making) because of the drang-and-drop nature of handling the files. Also, it was recently under a very **huge discount ($1.99 from the actual $25)**. I grabbed my copy then and have loved it ever since.

* [SublimeText 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2) - perhaps the most complete and polished **text/code editor** out there. This one is an absolute must if you are looking to do a lot of coding. I do not write the articles in Sublime Text because the monospace fonts are not ideal for writing longform text. But it's perfect for programming because of code completion, syntax highlighting, modifyable color schemes, multiple tabs and the extreme light-weight nature of the app.
* [Byword](http://bywordapp.com/) - the perfect **longform writing app.** It also offers markdown-processing in realtime and has a dark-mode that I really enjoy while writing long articles. Plus, it has Dropbox integration for syncing and storing incomplete articles so that its iOS apps can be used when I am typing/writing on-the-go. It's not even that expensive. Byword is always-on on my computer.
* [SourceTree](http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) - this is my tool of choice for **version control.** As I mentioned in my [previous article](http://hardik.co/blog/2013/Creating-a-light-weight-robust-static-website-for-free/), version control is very important for any kind of coding. I love to keep track of changes made over time on the website source. This can be possible with either GitHub or Bitbucket. I have chosen Bitbucket because of their free private repositories. To handle _commits_ and progress of code, I use SourceTree. It's a **free** tool available for Mac and is capable of handling Bitbucket repositories very well. I love it.

I also recommend [CyberDuck](http://cyberduck.ch/) which is an excellent **FTP client** (free) that handles SFTP and S3 connections very well. I used it for a long time and then tried ForkLift recently. ForkLift has stuck with me for now but I always have CyberDuck running just in case. 

For pictures and header images for the website, I use [Pixelmator](http://www.pixelmator.com/) which is an **image editor** that is capable of handling anything and everything related to images. 

This completes my toolset and workflow for publishing to this website and crafting the website design itself. If you have any questions, don't hesitate: hardik@hardik.co.
