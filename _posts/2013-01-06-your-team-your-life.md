title: "Your team, your life"
---

What unites a bunch of Spaniards, a few Portuguese, a few Argentines, a few Brazilians and a couple of Frenchmen under one roof? If you could guess correctly, I am talking about the football team squad of Real Madrid CF. And sports in general.

Why is sports so special? What is it that brought those different nationalities together? What is it that makes people so passionate and so emotional at times? What is it that makes us stick to our televisions and live streams so focused that we completely indulge in the moment and absorb the drama, forgetting any and everything around us? 

I believe it's the purpose. The purpose to overcome the fear and get past that finish line. The purpose of pushing your limits and making a dent. The purpose of winning. This is exactly why all the sports make the best icons. They teach us to win and to go to any length to make it happen. Sports make the best motivators and make the best of the characters. They show us how to win and be humble in defeat. To have the grit and perseverence to stick out there, observe sportsmanship and have a huge heart requires you to have a strong and an allround character. And by following the icons on the screen and stadiums, it sinks in our lives as their supporters. Unknowingly but surely. 

Today, most sports are team sports. They involve building great teams and building a legacy. Every team is special and follows a set of beliefs. That is what makes it unique and its followers 'die-hard'. When we follow a sport, we follow a team and we feel almost like a part of it. We share the same sentiments and legacy of the team we support and that makes the whole matter almost religious. It intertwines in our lives so much at the emotional level that it effectively decides our behaviour in real lives. Our team's victories are our victories and it motivates us more than anything else. Those eruptions of joys have helped us get ourselves out of the darkest hours in life. Do you remember the last time your team won or lost a match and the circumstances that followed? Yes, it either made your day or screwed it up. 

I could sum it up in one sentence: It's the team you follow/play for, that describes you. But more importantly, you have to be a part of it. One who lacks the best thing in life that sports is (after traveling), is a dull soul. He lacks the spice.

So go out there. Stay motivated. Win in life.
