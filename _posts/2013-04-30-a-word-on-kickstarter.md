title: "A word on Kickstarter"
---

There has been a massive shift in 'creating' stuff over the last few days on the Internet. Until 5 years back, pursuing the dream of creating art and cool content required finance and that prohibited many from doing so. That is not the case anymore. Crowdfunding has taken over the traditional means of financing and now people (the Internet crowd) pay you if they believe in your project or the work of art. [Kickstarter](http://kickstarter.com) has shown the way.

People turn to Kickstarter for two purposes:

First is the validation. When you put something on Kickstarter, people take a look at it. You get responses in terms of number of backers you get for your project. This way you know if the idea you have in mind is feasible in the eyes of the people or not. It also serves as a marketing medium. 

Second is obviously the funding. If people like your project and genuinely believe it's worth their money, they will fund it. For the funds that they promise to invest in the project, the owner of the project promises some goodies in return. These goodies may involve early beta access to software releases, special merchandise and other creative bonuses. 

Today Kickstarter has all kinds of projects listed. Recently Zach Braff (my favorite actor) [started a campaign to fund his new movie](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1869987317/wish-i-was-here-1). The target $2m funding was achieved in less than 72 hours (yes, I backed it!). Yes, in less than ​3 days. Such was the overwhelming response of people. 

I love Kickstarter and I am a frequent backer (today morning, [I backed this](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/johnonolan/ghost-just-a-blogging-platform)). ​It's fun and a new way to connect with your target audience. There are some insanely cool Kickstarter projects over the years. [This is an extensive list](http://www.t3.com/features/best-kickstarter-projects). 

​Next time you want to fund something cool and don't know how to finance it, consider Kickstarter.
