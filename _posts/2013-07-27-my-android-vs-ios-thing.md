title: "My Android vs iOS thing"
---

This stems from what I have experienced so far and might not be everyone's point of view. But I have grown to become pretty tolerant of everyone's taste of technology and accept the fact that it differs.

I understand that I project an impression that I do use Apple products and I am more often than not, pro-Apple. However, to be honest, I have used every possible mobile operating system out there (with the exception of the Windows Mobile). I used a BlackBerry for a while followed by an Android phone that was the HTC One. 

I loved the HTC One. It had a fantastic large screen that was great for web surfing, gaming and videos. And an almost perfect form factor too. Sadly, the battery-life proved to be defeating the purpose of the large screen. I cannot recall a single day when I dared to leave my house without a full charge. But to be fair, I did not see any other problems with the phone. Yes, probably a bit inferior app quality in the Play Store but it was manageable to work around that problem. So in the end, HTC bit the dust.

With iPhone (this was the first one I had bought back in 2010 and the rest followed later), my mindset was pretty clear. I wanted  to love it and I did. But more importantly, the more I used it since 2010, the more I invested in it (time and money). At the moment, my App Store account registers apps worth of about $150. After spending that money, I wouldn't want to start from scratch on a new platform. But that does not mean Android failed on me. Not at all. I loved it and I still do. They just need to figure out the battery issue somehow (the only thing that bugged me). 

So, Android or iOS, use whatever is your thing. Also, please get rid of the 'Sent from my iPhone' and 'Sent from my HTC' email signatures when you send mails from the phone.

The best smartphone is the one that does not come out of your pocket every 2 minutes.
