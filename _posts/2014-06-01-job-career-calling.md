I read this today. It stirred my conscience. It's powerful. It is almost a celebration in solitude.

It's the story of choosing **Should** and **Must**. All of us face this choice almost everyday and this story shows us how the choice sculpts us as a person either crafted by the forces from within or by the forces that are external.

This story strips you bare-naked to face your conscience. To face yourself and ask your heart about why you're not following your calling - why you're not following your gut. It's a spiritual experience to come around such a piece that will leave a lasting impact.

>Should is how *others* want us to show up in the world — how we’re supposed to think, what we ought to say, what we *should* or *shouldn’t* do. It’s the vast array of expectations that others layer upon us. **When we choose Should the journey is smooth, the risk is small.**

>Must is different — there aren’t options and we don’t have a choice.

>Must is who we are, what we believe, and what we do when we are alone with our truest, most authentic self. It’s our instincts, our cravings and longings, the things and places and ideas we burn for, the intuition that swells up from somewhere deep inside of us. **Must is what happens when we stop conforming to other people’s ideals and start connecting to our own.** Because when we choose *Must*, we are no longer looking for inspiration out there. Instead, we are listening to our calling from within, from some luminous, mysterious place.

**Thousand times Yes!**

>It is here, standing at the cliff’s edge, peering down below, hearing the siren’s call, that we feel the terrifying prospect of abandonment, failure, and humiliation. And this is the exact moment when people decide against taking the leap — to avoid that great unknown, that transformative place where nothing is written, nothing is guaranteed, and everything is possible.

>If you believe that you have something special inside of you, and you feel it’s about time you gave it a shot, honor that calling in some small way — today.

>If you’ve been peering out over the edge of the cliff but can’t quite make the leap, dig a little deeper and find out what’s stopping you — today.

Carnivalesque.
