title: "Launching our startup, finally!"
---

EventViva has been running for a few months now. We started it in 2012 with an ambition of making it a de facto standard for designing and marketing events online. It was never announced officially until today. Without much flashback, I will get into the details of what EventViva is, since that's the most interesting part.

If you really want to visit our website first (I know you want to), head over to [EventViva](http://eventviva.com) and take a look. We have launched a completely revamped and faster interface yesterday (nobody likes plain and white interfaces because it's just too boring (unless you are Google)).

## What is EventViva
EventViva is your event management and marketing platform. We are a medium. We connect event organisers with their target audience. If you are an event organiser, [make your event](http://eventviva.com/create) (by 'make', I mean 'go through a 30-second procedure of typing in details') on our website. **It's completely free to use.** 

Once you create an event,

* You grab the link of the event you made and share it through your media channels
* We promote your event to your desired audience (at no extra cost)
* We design and sell tickets for your event
* We charge you 2.5% of the ticket price on every ticket
* We collect the sales money and transfer them to you whenever you want
* We wait for you to create your next event

We have designed a state-of-the-art event marketing algorithm to target specific niche audience that you have in mind. We don't want to dime you for posting horrendously expensive banner ads all over the place. Because well, we all hate them! **We do marketing differently and gently.** We know from the kind of your event, the kind of audience you are targeting for. **And we specifically target them without incurring heavy marketing budgets on you.**

The experience of using our platform is sure to make organising events easy and painless. I personally have been using this platform for organising family occasions and gatherings and it has been flawless and hassle-free to use.

## Our perks

* EventViva is completely free to use (we only charge you 2.5% on each ticket when you sell tickets, and we **don't charge a penny for free events**)
* Our payments are handled securely through a website-wide **SSL** encryption
* We are capable of handling 20 currencies ($, £, € and even **₹**)
* Amazing database of constantly updated events, search anytime anywhere to see what's happening around you
* We have a **1-hour-guaranteed-response** policy on our support and query emails, so reach us on support@eventviva.com or contact@eventviva.com at any time)
* We (I and Aditya both) are active on Facebook and Twitter, always ready to listen to suggestions and feedback
* We love you and we love events

Oh and there is no catch (seriously, none!). 

## Why did I personally want to make this?

Because it's worth it. It's worth all the effort and midnight toil it has taken. I and Aditya had these entrepreneurial seeds within us since our college days and we wanted to explore this in a little more detail - almost like hands-on. 

There was no better way to experience the whole startup phase than to live one personally. So we decided on an idea (in 2011) and built it. Today when it's finally ready and out there in front of people, we feel proud and satisfied. When I saw people building web-based applications and products, I was always a little jealous and impressed. It's a surreal feeling to see an equally capable product made by ourselves. 

## Social presence

As of now, the new website of EventViva is very much live. Check it out at [www.eventviva.com](http://eventviva.com). Don't forget to follow [@EventViva](http://twitter.com/eventviva) if you use Twitter. We also have a [Facebook page](http://facebook.com/eventviva) where we share interesting updates about some lovely events that we find hosted on our platform. 

If you happen to notice any bugs or have suggestions about performance improvement, we would be very thankful to hear that from you. Please shoot us a mail on **support@eventviva.com** in that case.

## What's ahead for EventViva?

Well it has just begun. I'm not saying it will become an overnight success, but the start has been very successful and rewarding. We really believe in this thing we made and we really wish it makes your day better by aiding you in managing your events. **Because after all, entrepreneurship is all about identifying the right problems and solving them.**

**We are going to organise a few demo days across Ahmedabad and we are also open to meeting people who want to host their events with us. For any such inquiries, send a mail on contact@eventviva.com or hardik@hardik.co.**

To my friends and peers who are still in that little dilemma before starting something themselves, consider this - 'Being a part of the status quo will not enable you to change the status quo. Step out. Make yourself heard, seen and noticed. Because when you put in hard work and burn your heart out for something you are passionate about, the world will give a damn.'
