title: "LaTeX resume"
---
Well, building a resume is not an easy task. Making it fit into one single page is even more difficult. One faces the ultimate challenge of what to include and what to omit. I have long ditched the idea of making resumes in MS Word or any word processors for that matter. It's just so much unnecessary friction. 

I have just finished building my own resume from a semi-ready template in LaTeX. Since it was LaTeX, the only real effort left was to compile information in the document, which was a breeze.

I use a two-column layout and have successfully been able to produce a clean resume from a LaTeX code that covers pretty much all I want to say. It looks sleek as I have managed to use [Avenir](http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/avenir/) as the main font (a total win!). Also, in the code, the colours used are HTML hex codes and can be modified easily. Use [this free colour picker](http://www.colorpicker.com/) to get the hex codes for the colour you want.

I have opened up the source code of the LaTeX file so you can download and edit as you like. Use XeLaTeX build to compile this LaTeX code file.
