A father probably never gets enough credit for what he does for his family. 

One of the most important things my father told me -

> What you know (the facts and figures) is information and not wisdom. Anyone can gain access to information. What you do with the information, is wisdom. Focus on that.

Cannot thank him enough. Indebted forever.

Wish your father today. Say 'Thank You'.
