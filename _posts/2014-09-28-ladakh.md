Alright. I don't know from where to begin. I just came back from a week long trip to Ladakh. So many scenes and so much nature to inhale in such a small time period.

I would try my best to share my experiences with photos here but I would warn you that no amount of photos can do justice to what's on offer in that part of the world - **stellar statistics for the altitude-nerds, astoundingly close Lines of Control for the military enthusiasts and amalgamation of hues for the photography-nerds like I am.** There's just so much to take in, so I'll start with some photographs and share a few bits of information around them.

You can plan to visit places such as: Buddhist monasteries, lakes, sand dunes, valleys and military camps. Ladakh is not a place where you'll get to see a lot of vegetation and green nature. There's just **miles and miles full of nothingness.** **There are vast expanses of open spaces and bare mountains embodying silence and meditative spirit.** Peace is the gist of the place. The roads speak of the trails people traveling around have left and the mountains ooze accounts of adventures witnessed. Serenity and nothingness make you one with nature.

If you think all this is too poetic, you've to visit the place to let all this realize in front of your eyes.

It is very hard to pick photos that display the true magnificence of nature but I tried my best here. There're plenty of photos that are worthy of sharing but those will end up on [my Instagram](http://instagram.com/hvpandya).

Lungs gasped for more oxygen as we climbed up the snowy mountains to reach one of the most exciting and adventurous locations of the world - the [Khardungla Pass](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khardung_La) at the elevation of 18,380 ft. It's a very important and strategically vital point to protect the Indian part of Kashmir from intruders and hence a lot of military presence was noticed. It's also mentioned at the Pass that staying there for more than 20-25 minutes can be harmful to health as the air is really thin for breathing and physically extensive activities are discouraged.

An item checked off the bucket list there.

**Nubra Valley** is another attractive place. Going there is very tiring since it's about 120 km from Leh by road. Although the roads are well-built and maintained, it can be tiring and frustrating due to the low oxygen density and curvy bends along the road. But reaching there, everything seems worth the hassle. The place is just magestic. There're sand-dunes, two-humped camels for a nice evening ride and there're plenty of locals there to amuse you with folk entertainment. The valley is bustling with life amid lifeless barren mountains.

Finally, the apex of the trip was the grand [Pangong Tso](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pangong_Tso) lake. It's the filming location of more than 10 bollywood movies and so many music videos. Almost 60% of this lake is a part of China. The Line of Actual Control passes through this lake. It was thrilling to know that we were so close to the international border between India and China. The route to the lake is very scenic and goes through another ridiculously high Changla Pass (17,586 ft). We experienced a heavy snowfall atop the Changla Pass. The weather was not permitting and harsh in the morning. Gloomy burst of clouds covered our vision and it was almost too scary, but we marched on.

### A salute to the Indian Army

Everything developed and maintained in this challenging terrain is thanks to the efforts of the Indian Army. They have been permanent residents of such inhabitable conditions and have been doing so to protect and guard our country. We're safe because they're there. I didn't know much about how tough situations were for them before I visited Ladakh. [Siachen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siachen_Glacier) is even worse. Subzero temperatures, thin air making it difficult to breathe and chilly winds are the least of their worries. Constant intrusions of neighboring troops make their days very hard and they have to maintain their watch on the Line of Control. I can only imagine patroling such terrains everyday to make sure your country is safe. **Even with a life full of so many ordeals, they greeted every single tourist with a warm smile and a wave of hands without a hint of tiredness.** A well-deserved salute for the *Jawaans* out there. They are the real heroes.

We managed to witness the landing of the huge [Globemaster III from Boeing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_C-17_Globemaster_III) at the Leh IAF base. Patriotism and technological war-nerdery soared to their highs. *Excuse the less than ideal quality of the photo, my hands were shaking.*
