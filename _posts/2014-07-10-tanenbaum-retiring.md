I started my career in Data Communication and Networking through his textbooks. His papers inspired and guided many students and researchers in the field of networking and computers and he has been an authoritative voice in this field for almost 4 decades.

I am very glad to have been a part of his stream of research and academia and I don't plan to change it anytime soon.

A salute to the flag-bearer of this wonderful era of digital communication as he finally retires from academic duties. His farewell lecture is this September at the [VU](http://vu.nl) and I wish I could attend it (I'm not in the Netherlands at that time).
