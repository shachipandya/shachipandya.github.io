title: "Presenting LiveNote"

**There goes an interesting anecdote in the technology world: When there does not exist a tool you need, you build it yourself (and then open it up for others to use, for there will surely be more people needing it).**

Here we go: [www.livenote.org](http://www.livenote.org)

I and Aditya normally code [EventViva](http://eventviva.com) and several other lucrative projects simultaneously. We collaborate while being a few hundred kilometers apart. That process is not easy and sometimes keeping track of things and hacking on the same code at the same time gets too clumsy.

*We strived for a solution for a while. There was none. We wanted a simple text application that could let us edit the same document in real-time reflecting changes we make immediately.*

What did we do? We built one! Today we release [LiveNote](http://www.livenote.org) - our first launch of 2014. The collective hours spent on development are ~20 in the span of last 4 days. But to be honest, the fun we had outweighs the hassle of developing it from ground up.

It's open for everyone to use and it's free. **The changes one person makes in the document sync live and instantaneously for the other fellow to see.** Just start with a draft and send the link to the other person willing to collaborate; and let the magic happen. Go ahead and see it for yourself!

*We plan to open up the source later on if we think it can be useful to others.*
