Today dear friend David at [MacSparky](http://macsparky.com) published a home screen post about me where I showed off my iPhone home screen and some of the apps that make my work easy.  

All the apps on my home screen are summed up there with an explanation of why they are there. Do take a look.

I have a few apps that are worth mentioning (those that don't appear on my home screen but rather on the second screen):

- [Limelight](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/limelight-your-movie-library/id636583114?mt=8): a perfect companion for movie lovers. I have made my library of movies that I want to see and a library of movies that I have seen (with my reviews). This one is visually (and functionally) more attractive compared to the IMDb app.
- [PDFpen](http://www.smilesoftware.com/PDFpen/index.html): this one is recommended by David Sparks himself on almost all of his podcasts. The capability to sign, edit and tweak PDF files in any manner right from my iOS device is something important to me. This one has to be there! 
- [BTT Remote](http://bttremote.com/) : a utility app to control your Mac from your iPhone (over wifi). It's free and useful.
- [LiveScore](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/livescore/id356928178?mt=8) : for a sports fan this one is a must-have. It's free and it shows live scores of pretty much all the sports. I only use it to follow football scores though but it is very useful to all sports fanatics. 

That sums up the important ones that I regularly use. For everything else, there's the MacBook Pro.
