title: "Tunes from the heavens"

Venue: Malieveld, The Hague in the Netherlands.

Attendees: 70,000+

It's quite obvious that when a crowd this big with people from all around Holland and probably from 3-4 countries nearby makes it all the way to a rather bland-on-an-off-day garden venue, the stage-men are pretty big. My second Coldplay concert because well, one obviously wasn't enough. 

Starting with the iconic introduction tune (they kept it the same throughout their concerts worldwide) to the very moment they pick up 'Hurts Like Heaven', it's a butterflies-in-the-stomach time. Witnessing the magicians we have heard for so long on our music players is phenomenal. The amazing tunes of 'Paradise' and the iconic twinkling of the wrist-bands throughout the concert (peaking the blink-rate in the song 'Charlie Brown') is something no other band in the world is capable of. The charismatic image of the concert embosses itself on the mind which is bound to last forever. The little butterflies shooting from the sky in 'In My Place' and the balloons bumping around in the arena in 'Yellow' create a unique connection to the fans with the band. Every single moment of the performance is the band actually saying to each and every fan present, 'We love you!'. The chilling tunes of 'God Put A Smile Upon Your Face' and the culmination of adrenalin at the end with Chris hurling the guitar in the air is truly memorable. 

Okay, enough of the description! A picture is worth a thousand words as they say. Here are some of the best we managed to capture (trying not to miss even a single second of the experience in the process).

No need to stress again on the fact that it was amazing. Firecrackers, light effects, wrist-bands, balloons, paper cuttings falling from the sky and this list can just go on! But one thing I would not want to forget is to ask you all to not to miss out on a Coldplay concert if you get a chance. It will be your best experience in life. I can safely vouch for it having see them play twice now.

For the not-so-lucky ones, there is a movie coming up of Coldplay shot at their concerts (mainly the footage of their Paris concert this year) this November (on my birthday actually!). That one is surely going to be a collector's edition.

Here is the trailer:

The perfect tribute to the band? Here it is - God once said, 'Let there be symphony!' and Chris Martin was born.

PS: I might have sounded biased in all the superlative adjectives I used for the band in this post but I cannot help but say, they deserve every-bit of praise that goes their way.
