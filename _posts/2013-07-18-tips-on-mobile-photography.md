[Jorge Quinteros](http://jorgeq.com) (an excellent photographer himself) linked to a very fine set of tips on mobile photography.

When I went through the list, I found a few which are right on the money. They are valid not only for mobile photography but for any photography that you like. Here, I compile the ones I loved in a short list (all 50 are worth a mention to be honest) - 

- Zoom with your feet and not with your phone.
- Backup your shots: Cloud, Dropbox, a physical disk or anything. Pick two and stick to them. There are IFTTT recipes (such as [this one](https://ifttt.com/recipes/25679)) for automating back ups of your photos from social networks.
- 'Likes' are a measure of popularity not quality. They are not the same thing.
- Tag-bombing is uncool. Tag for yourself and not for the 'Likes'.
- Natural is more interesting than posed.
- You can’t take a good photo with the iPhone flash.
- Follow the light. Follow mobile photographers who see the light.
- Shoot for yourself and not anyone else.
- Put your mobile photos on your own blog. Don’t just give them to social networks. They could disappear any day. Also, back them up! 
- Share your photo secrets. No one can steal your personal vision.
