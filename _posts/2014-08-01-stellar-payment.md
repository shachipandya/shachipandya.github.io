title: Finally a payment system for the Internet
---

I bet you heard the news. Payment gateway company [Stripe](http://stripe.com) launched [Stellar](http://stellar.org).

**Stellar is the payment gateway system (protocol) for the Internet that is not for profit.** It's sort of like bitcoins but much more accessible to normal people without the overhead of bitcoins. It's true that the Internet required some kind of a system to handle payments instantaneously and it's quite surprising it didn't have one till now. But it's hopefully sorted.

With Stellar, it's possible to send and receive money using just your username across the Internet. It's a currency protocol that is decentralized and hence enables interchange of different currencies across the globe. 

### This is how Stellar works

<div class="box">Sender's currency &#8594; Stellars &#8594; Recipient's currency</div> 

If you have traded in bitcoins ever, you would know that the cryptocurrencies work on the principle of the network doing the *authentication* of payments. Stellar works in the same way. And hence transactions get processed in a matter of minutes (if not seconds).

Read the [Stellar FAQ](https://www.stellar.org/faq/) for more information on this.

> I just hope it would replace PayPal.

For now, join Stellar and receive some free *stellars*. Since this has potential to become huge in near future, get your vanity username now.

I am @hardik if you're planning to try out sending a few stellars.

*Update: As expected, [HN is going crazy over this right now](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8114901).*
