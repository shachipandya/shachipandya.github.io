title: World of Multi-tools and Swisstool Spirit X
---

I got started in this domain a month ago when I began exploring what multi-tools really are. Machines, tools and manufacturing hardware always fascinated me being the son of a mechanical engineer. I love tools with good finish that have multiple utility and everyday use.

Not a lot of people may be interested in this domain and to be honest, it's one of those isolated and nich√© areas of the Internet where you could get information and reviews about such tools. When I began exploring the multi-tools, two of the industry giants came to the surface - Leatherman and Victorinox. Both of them have been manufacturing the best multi-tools for years (Victorinox has been doing it for over a century now). So these were the brands I began exploring.

I would like to share here that I had no prior experience with Leatherman while I already owned a couple of Victorinox mini-tools for years (my father bought them from his visits to Switzerland over the years). So there may be a bit of a bias in this article in that regard but overall I appreciate the Swiss make a bit more than the American one of the Leathermans.

I have already had the [Victorinox Super Tinker](http://www.amazon.com/Victorinox-Swiss-Super-Tinker-Pocket/dp/B000MLU8PE) that I bought a couple of years ago in Interlaken. It's a smooth little tool for everyday use that covers the most of the needs an average day would require. It **still doesn't have locking blades** though. This is important (which I recently came to know) so as to not hurt yourself while operating on a little heavier tasks. Locking blades normally are not a forte of pocket-tools, you require more like a medium-sized heavier duty tools for that functionality.

The medium-sized multi-tools form the category of survival knives. They do more than good-enough job of cutting, sawing, filing, opening stuff and breaking stuff. They are more for outdoor purposes than just everyday household tasks. I wanted one from this category. A medium-to-heavy duty tool that can do more.

I consulted some online articles to know and explore what the experts were saying. There's an [excellent review from Adam Savage's team](http://www.tested.com/art/makers/458714-best-multitool-today/) on his website. The same review also appeared on the famous [Wirecutter](http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-multitool/). They heralded the [Leatherman Wave](http://www.leatherman.com/10.html) as the best-value for the price with superior durability and utility. The [Victorinox Swisstool Spirit X](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0027MSC2M?tag=thewire06-20&linkCode=as2) came in as the "luxury" version that had a better build and a little better durability for the higher price.

## I chose Victorinox Swisstool Spirit X

I sided with the Vic. I loved the lesser weight of the tool (Vic is about 50gm lighter than the Wave) and superior build quality. I felt the Leatherman Wave in my hands in a local store and it was really heavy. The Swisstool is a bit slender and sleek. Interestingly, in India, Swisstool comes out a lot cheaper compared to the Wave! It's because of the shipping and import duty differences but that means you can get the better tool at a lower price. Win.

**Even with the functionality, Swisstool wins - it has 27 'features' compared to Wave's 17.** The difference is stark. As Wirecutter puts it in their review, there's almost nothing Wave does that the Swisstool doesn't. And the Swisstool does even more. The only thing I miss is to have a good seat-belt cutting blade that's a part of a lot of newer tools nowadays. I hope to not need it though. The standard knife-blade should come handy in case.

Leatherman's changeable bit-driver is nice. Swisstool only has a fixed-size Phillips screwdriver alongwith 2 other flat-head drivers. Not much versatility if you run into uncommon screw-head sizes. But it works in *most* situations.

*The Swisstool allows all tools to be opened **without** opening up the pliers.* All tools are accessible from the outside. This alone trumps everything. It's so useful to be able to do this in actual usage. Leatherman has 4 major blades accessible this way but for the other features, you need to open up the pliers to access them. Not a deal-breaker but surely a pain-point. It's also important to note that **all tools and blades on the Swisstool and the Wave are locking.** In some countries, this feature renders carrying such a tool illegal. I don't think that's a problem here in India.

The carrying sheath that comes with the Vic is also much classier and sturdily built. Full leather with the Victorinox logo.

The Leatherman Wave is way more popular as I have discovered over time and is also the choice of Adam Savage himself. But that doesn't mean it's the best out there. It's the *best value for price*. I have my reasons to choose Victorinox and you may have yours. 

## Why multi-tools

I am a geek and I love being able to open up stuff at will. I like to break things and fix them later on. Tools that enable me to do that are handy. To be honest, we all need one or the other tool for regular jobs around the house and in the backyard. In those situations, it's nice to know I have something to work with in case something breaks. Nowadays, I don't go anywhere without my trusted multi-tool.

I have explored this domain a lot for the last 1 month and I have tons of resources full of information in case you are interested in getting a tool for yourself. There's Gerber, Kershaw, SOG, HK, Victorinox, Leatherman, Spyderco and tons of other manufacturers who make interesting tools for different tasks. Hit me up with any questions you may have (mail@hardikpandya.com) and I will be glad to help you out.
