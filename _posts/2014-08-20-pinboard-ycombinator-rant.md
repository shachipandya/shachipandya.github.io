title: "Pinboard's Maciej Ceglowski and the YC Demo Day Hilarity"
---

First of all, [Pinboard](http://pinboard.in) is awesome. And this rant was epic.

[YC](http://ycombinator.com) had a demo day a day ago. As I mentioned in my last article, most startups were borderline banal and barely sustainable. VCs give them funding as if these startups are going to change the world. Such is the state of Silicon Valley (is there any actual Silicon startups even left there?).

**Nothing** changes the world in the blink of an eye and definitely not a bunch of kids with a cool software. *We need better ideas.*

Maciej went on a rant on Twitter and I collected some of the funniest tweets below. Peruse at your own peril!
