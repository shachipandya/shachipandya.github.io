* Red = lowest
* Yellow = low
* Blue = high
* Violet = highest

I don't like the way India is in the range of 80-85, and I don't even know what class of people they experimented with to come up with such a low range of IQ. **Mexico, Argentina, England, Thailand, Vietnam, Turkey** and some other countries actually are rated better than India. I strongly **disagree.**

At the same time, China's rating couldn't be more stereotyped of the 'Asians being smart' idea.
