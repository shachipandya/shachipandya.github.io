title: "The juice of microblogging"
---

Microblogging is not a new concept in any case. It's been there since the inception of Twitter and Tumblr and other services alike. It can be explained as simply as this: short form creations with a couple of lines of content and/or pictures (mostly just pictures). At times it's easier to create this way because it doesn't require a serious commitment and neither a certain depth of thoughts the longer articles need. 

This is not to say that microblogging is bad or easy. There have been tremendously impressive and successful microblogs running for years. I love the [Cabin Porn](http://cabinporn.com), Startup Quotes and This Isn't Happiness microblogs personally.

This works pretty well since the posts or pictures take usually a few seconds to read and hence content can be consumed much faster. It's really like 'glance over it, and move on'. I love this idea (but then again, I love writing longer articles too).

To take this a bit more seriously, I began testing out microblogging services and liked [Tumblr](http://tumblr.com). So I started one myself. I named it Freshly Hashed because I love the feel it gives - just hashed, still pretty fresh, coming straight to you!

It's going to be a tough task updating it multiple times a day. But I will give it a shot. Because I can always take a look at it one day and reminisce what I found interesting over these times and how my interests and vision changed!

With the current Internet era, tools to do stuff are in abundance and cheaper than ever.

Ultimately, power to you!
