title: "Some things are just worth doing!"
---

First of all, this post has been long due. Maybe some music connoisseurs made it out from the title and if not, well its about The Dewarists. Its not quite often that a TV show comes and just takes your breath away, but this is one! One can say that this post is merely a humble tribute to what is much more than a showcase of Indian music and culture. 

They have a YouTube channel: [Link](http://www.youtube.com/user/DewarsIndia)

To be honest, there has never been a show like this on television. At least not on Indian television for sure. The Dewarists started as a show featuring music artists across the country. Taking in a small clique of musicians in each episode, they make an honest attempt at making a musical masterpiece by the end of the episode. And boy they do it with style! Just pick up any episode of the whole series and you are bound be mesmerised with the panache and creativity of the artists. Every episode is filmed at a very very simple and yet almost a tranquillising and serene location. Be it the austere Rajasthan in the Minds Without Fear (the season opener) featuring Vishal Dadlani and the world renowned Imogen Heap who combine to set the tone for the whole (then) upcoming season. Minds Without Fear, almost from the beginning of the tune itself lights up the passion and drives it home through its powerful lyrics.

And of course it was not the only song to do so. Show host Monica Dogra and the team travels all across the country to find and collaborate with distinct qualities of some famous and some not so famous musicians. The beauty and simplicity of the show is such that for a while, it stops becoming all about music and takes us to a whole new artistic level. Be it 'Masti Ki Basti' with Raghu Dixit or 'I Believe' with Agnee, Shilpa Rao and Parikrama, the melodies created are just breath-taking. 

The part that is most enjoyable? It has to be the cinematography. The way every episode is filmed, you start praying it rather never ended! Every tune is so pure, every sound is so true in itself and every location is so divine that the show is a collector's edition. Monica (being an artist herself from the Shaa'ir+Func) does a superb job of narrating every single episode with the same sombre voice and virtuoso style. 

To those who have not yet touched the beauty and magic, I strongly advice them to do so. For sure its bound to be a memorable experience. For us all fans, the show renews itself to the next edition starting 28th October. Surely a point to look forward to! 

Only one reason is strong enough to drive the soul of the show: Because some things are just worth doing! (You have to listen to this in Monica's voice!)

Good luck!
