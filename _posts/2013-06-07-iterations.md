Those who visit this website of mine must have noticed something changed every time they opened it. Such is the nature of the web. And pretty much everything. I keep making changes to the website to make it more accessible (faster load times) and more readable (better colours and contrasts). I had used grey fonts on a dark background for far too long and had several suggestions to go for the 'usual' web tradition of dark on light. So I did. Now it's grey fonts on a #ffffff  board.

I also edit my resume a lot. I make small changes in the colour scheme, arrangements of sections in a better way and I also sometimes imitate someone's better design when I feel mine needs a revamp. This is normal because I believe nothing ever becomes perfect but you can always strive to approach perfection.  

Sometimes I receive criticism for changing things too much and not being consistent with my design (I have pushed new versions of this website about 482 times with minor changes and other countless offline iterations). But well, I only do it to make it better.  

In life, this applies to almost everything. Iterate as many times as you feel the need. First 10 times will not even be as good. Everyday when I see my own work, I find at least 3 things I can change to make it better.

There's a quote I have read/heard a lot of times over the Internet -

>When you are designing (or making) something, sleep over it before finalising it. Because when you wake up the next day and look at it again, you will definitely have an idea to change it in some way for good.

Because getting better never stops!
