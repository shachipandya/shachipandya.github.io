### Quotes

- How does somebody know what they want if they have never even seen it? *(this should be the motivation for all product design and innovation companies)*
- A tool should give people freedom to create, to build, and to visualise.
- You know why people buy an Apple and not the competitor? It's because it's got the bravado, it's the social status, the social currency.
- Great artists - Dylan, Picasso - they **risk everything.** Everything *[in order to achieve what they have]*.
- I'd rather gamble on our vision than make a 'me too' product.
- If you don't share our enthusiasm and care for the company, get out.
- We don't do "just fine". We don't stop innovating.
- You have got to have a problem you want to solve. You have got to have a wrong that you want to right. Or you won't have the perseverance to stick to it.
- We can't look at the competition and say we are going to do it better, we look at the competition and say we will do it **differently.**
- In your life, you can only get to do so many things, and right now, we have chosen this *[the Mac]*, so lets make this great.
- A product should be a natural extension of your self. Of your existence.
- *[On his return to Apple]* This company will not make shit. Time to make Apple cool again.

**And here's the best one (it has completely changed the way I look at life):**

- When you grow up, you tend to get told that the world is the way it is and to live your life as you're told, trying not to bash into the walls too much. But that's a very limited life. Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact: everything around you that you call life was made up by people who are no smarter than you. And you can change it. You can influence it. 

And then comes the magic moment at 1:57:20 in the movie: The great **'Here's to the crazy ones...'** monologue. Precious stuff.
