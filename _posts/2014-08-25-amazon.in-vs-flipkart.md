title: "Amazon.in and Flipkart"
---

Both are non-Indian to begin with. One comes from an already gigantic backdrop in the United States and the other is held by a company registered as a Singaporean venture.

Online shopping is becoming a huge in India lately. For the last 3-4 years, increasing amount of people are gaining Internet access through cheap smartphones and hence are turning towards shopping for stuff online. Price-drops in smartphones with Internet connectivity has fuelled the growth of e-commerce immensely.

As a result, **Flipkart has become one of the 10 most visited websites in India according to Alexa.** They're expanding day and night and are quickly becoming a household name.

But take all this with a grain of salt. Because there's Amazon.in too in the picture now.

As we know, recently when [Flipkart announced their $1bn funding](http://www.forbes.com/sites/saritharai/2014/07/29/indias-flipkart-raises-1-billion-among-the-largest-in-single-funding-round-in-global-e-commerce/), Amazon, the very next day [announced that they are pouring $2bn in Amazon.in](http://online.wsj.com/articles/amazon-to-invest-2-billion-in-india-1406700828) to expand their business in India. Amazon is not taking it easy at all and are fiercely competing to get a hold of this largest consumer market in the world.

##Amazon > Flipkart

In many ways, odds are in the favor of Amazon. They've seen it all and done it all before. They have had countless number of controversies and lawsuits to fight in the US for their online book business, consumer product business and for simply putting local retailers out of business. They weathered it all albeit with minor hiccups. The important thing is that they are still there and they are still the king when it comes to online shopping.

Amazon is technologically very strong. They use their own infrastructure and have probably the largest computer infrastructure in the world. They have proven track-record in being able to successfully scale at unimaginable levels. They have even tamed the supply-chain elephant quite gracefully.

Amazon also has way larger product portfolio to offer. With pretty much everything on their product catalog and with an already strong delivery-chain experience, they have a lot going in their favor.

In the case of Flipkart, they have obvious frailties. There's no doubt that they have managed to make e-commerce "happen" in a market where there was no hope and where Amazon would've never entered so soon if not for Flipkart. That definitely goes to their credit.

But there's not much else in their favor that make them a strong competitor. Granted they are slightly more popular with the locals at the moment but operational difficulties may eventually wear them down.

##Flipkart issues

As has already been seen, they have been facing a lot of issues regarding returns of purchases and unhappy customers. They have not yet managed to establish a robust chain of returns.

I will quote my personal experience here.

<div class="aside">Out of 5 recent orders that I made on Flipkart, 3 were not delivered at all. They simply didn't come even 5 days after the last delivery date they promised. This is a recipe for losing trust and authenticity.</div>

This is the reason I use Cash-On-Delivery option most of the time. I don't want to deal with the customer support every time an item doesn't arrive.

There are also huge price discrepancies between them and Amazon. Maybe that is because of different publisher and supplier deals and contracts but still, all that means nada to the customer (especially the Indian customer). A price-gap of about â‚¹150 is a deal-breaker for me especially if I can order for a Cash-On-Delivery on both Amazon and Flipkart.

</ul>

This is an actual statement on Flipkart.com's FAQ page:

Well I of course had no idea!

###Acquisition is looking inevitable

I'm not against Flipkart. But they have odds stacked against them big-time. The brightest side of this is that they may eventually get acquired by Amazon. I don't know if that will be good or bad for the e-commerce market in India but that looks like the most likely outcome sooner rather than later. Of course competition is in the end good for the end-user and we'll reap benefits out of this in the form of better services and products. But it looks rather one-sided at the moment.

Jeff Bezos is a tough nut to crack and he's proven it time and again. Having dealt with so many rugged book publishers and retailers around the world and still having found a way to do business, he's shown he's a wise-ass. And he will not budge and hence the Bansals have their task cut-out for them.

Amazon will take this fight right down to the wire and perhaps (more likely than not) just win it.
