title: "Hardware startups - why so less?"
---
This is a topic I have wondered about for far too long. I thought I might as well share it.

Since the beginning of time till the computers became a reality in the 70s, there only used to be hardware businesses and bartering. But when the computers became popular, it became ever so easy to make money off of software.

There are a several factors why software boom happened and why we see so many software startups today - way more than their hardware counterparts. 

Firstly, software startups have far less overhead in set up compared to the hardware ones. In hardware startups, foremost requirement is production house or a manufacturing factory - real estate. I am not saying software startups do not require real estate but at least that is not their first priority. 

Secondly, software startups have possibly the easiest delivery cycles. They mostly are just one click downloads after you pay. For hardware startups, the scene is different. There you have to engage into contracts with raw material suppliers, delivery and shipping managers and the most complicated of them all - the resellers and traders. Tackling taxation laws and duties along the way are an added pain. 

Thirdly, initial investments. Software startups normally require as much as an Internet enabled computer (and server costs as they scale up). However high-end may that be. Again, it's not the same in case of hardware startups. There you need investments for manufacturing machines, factory equipments and testing tools plus almost always, computers! This is a major inhibitor.

Fourthly, fail cycles. In software startups, if the product has a bug or a compromising feature (which got discovered after shipping), it can be rectified in a matter of hours by pushing an update to it to the customers. Sadly, this is not possible with hardware. When you buy something only to realise that it's faulty, there is a painful 'send-it-back-and-we-replace-it' process that takes days. This requires meticulous customer relations department and support department to achieve seamlessly. Most entrepreneurs are not attracted by all that.

Lastly, product iterations. While engineering a product, in software startups, you can do as many changes in your product and test them for as low a cost as free. In hardware, the more tests and iterations you do on your product, it's the money spent that is not coming back. This is a major difference. You could change your software 50 times a day making small changes. You can't do so with your smart watch or fitness monitor band with the same liberty and speed.

All these reasons aside though, I do want to see more innovative hardware products and production practices in startups.

I support and love hardware startups no matter how sparse they are. That is why I cannot wait for my [Jawbone Up](http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2013/04/jawbone-up/) to arrive!
