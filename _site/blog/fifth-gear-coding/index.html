          <h5 class="article-subtitle">An account of my latest coding and code-learning spree</h5>



        <p>I always thought I would program and design applications and software for people to use. With the advent of amazing frameworks and ever-growing list of helpful tools, it&rsquo;s easier than ever to begin doing exactly that - developing kickass software and apps.</p>

<div class="aside">Good software is sexy.</div>


<p>I&rsquo;m a sucker for well-designed apps - on iOS, OS X and web. My love for great software grows tenfold when I&rsquo;m able to reserve a table at a restaurant or book a movie ticket in a jiffy on my phone while driving my car. That&rsquo;s real value you give to your users. That&rsquo;s software being sexy.</p>

<a name="I.Wanted.to.Be.a.Maker"></a>
<h2>I Wanted to Be a Maker</h2>

<p>Every time I used great software, it made me want to make something like that of my own. It made me want to be the creator of such delight. A great way to do this is to enable and equip yourself with enough knowledge to be able to do so.</p>

<p>So I started learning to code (almost 4 years ago now). Initially it was HTML, CSS and basic web stuff. I made myself comfortable with the nuances of how the web worked and started working on some front-end stuff (that work resulted in the design of <a href="http://eventviva.com">EventViva</a>).</p>

<p>I was still barely able to think of actual full-stack app design though. Maybe not even close. I didn&rsquo;t know any of the &ldquo;cool&rdquo; languages like JavaScript or jQuery. All I made was static pages that stayed on the screen like <strong>a lazy-sloth-party doing nothing (but at the same time, mocking me with judgmental faces at my ignorance of real app-design knowledge).</strong></p>

<p>It was time to change that. It was time to learn some cool new tools that would enhance my value.</p>

<a name="Up.came.Treehouse"></a>
<h2>Up came Treehouse</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://teamtreehouse.com">Treehouse</a>. I bought the membership there and started learning some stuff on it. I know, there are plenty of places on the web to start to learn coding. Many are even free. I had forayed into many of them but none had stuck. Treehouse was also a little hard to get habituated to. Also, unlike the free alternatives (which are not even that good to be honest), Treehouse costs a non-trivial amount of money ($25/month for a pro membership). But to be honest <strong>it was the money that kind of forced me to stick to a daily routine of finishing lessons after lessons (this is how a gym membership is supposed to help you get off your butt, but it most definitely doesn&rsquo;t!).</strong></p>

<p><figure>

</figure></p>

<p>But I started. I quickly became addicted to the <strong>video followed by a quiz/programming exercise</strong> style of learning. It grew on me and I started finishing course after course. I couldn&rsquo;t believe that the concepts I was so afraid of learning so far were nothing but a 6 hour tutorial away from being the hammer of my toolset.</p>

<p><strong>The great thing about Treehouse is that the content is really really of high value.</strong> It even has a gamification metric so you can earn points and badges as you progress through chapters. Hey, everything helps! By now, I&rsquo;ve almost paid 5 months worth of subscription fees and have learned stuff that will stay with me forever. That&rsquo;s value for money.</p>

<p>I cannot learn by reading the books (maybe that&rsquo;s the right way to learn, but who cares) and I would rather build stuff and break stuff and test stuff and learn along the way. At least this is the method that works with coding since you can always see your creations brought to life right on your lap (no pun).</p>

<a name="Onwards.to.AngularJS"></a>
<h2>Onwards to AngularJS</h2>

<p>So my coding journey continues and I couldn&rsquo;t be happier. I am now on to AngularJS and hope to get myself accustomed to it in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>Meanwhile I am also working on a web-app where I&rsquo;m using all these newly learned tools and I will share more information about in a few days.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re looking to learn to code and learn something specific, Treehouse has an <a href="http://teamtreehouse.com/library">awesome portfolio of courses</a> that would make your nerd-mouth water. As always, it&rsquo;s never too early nor too late when you want to learn. Hop on!</p>
