        <p>Recently Google shut down the Reader. I loved it and from the look of it (going by the reactions of people on Twitter and App.net), thousands of others did so as well. This was utterly harsh and well since we did not pay for the service it seemed painfully fair. Quite a lot of discussions began on the topic: Can you make your workflow arsenal independent of Google services?</p>

<p><a href="http://brooksreview.net/2013/03/quit-i-dare-you/">​Recently Ben Brooks and Marco Arment reviewed the situation</a> and suggested users to stop riding the Google bandwagon altogether if this tyranny really bothered them. Brooks analysed the situation and came up with pretty good suggestions. I personally like the alternatives he gave for emails.</p>

<p>Blocking off Google from your lives is not easy because there are just too many products from them that we use. But it is possible.</p>

<p>For mail, I have used <a href="http://fastmail.fm">FastMail</a> and have been nothing but impressed. So that is definitely an option worth looking at. Plus, we as customers pay for the mail and hence have no reason to worry about being shown the exit door. For search, I would say Bing is an option (better or not can only be verified after a certain amount of experience with it) but I find <a href="http://duckduckgo.com">DuckDuckGo</a> much friendlier. As Ben says, it&rsquo;s different but definitely cleaner and benign.</p>

<p>For cloud storage, I would say <a href="http://dropbox.com">Dropbox</a> has no competitors right now. If you are using something else, stop! And switch to Dropbox right away. I have never used Google Drive and never intend to do so. ​</p>

<p>For the browser, I was a big fan of Chrome but now I do not morally want to use it anymore. I have happily switched to Safari (with occasional bursts of Firefox) which goes down fairly well with my Mac-iOS integration and bookmarking.  ​</p>

<p>For RSS readers, well isn&rsquo;t that where all of this began? Google Reader is going and <a href="http://www.feedafever.com/">Fever</a> and <a href="http://feedbin.me">Feedbin.me</a> seem nice options.​ Fever is a self-hosted RSS reader and does not setup out of the box. It has to be ported manually on a server (after buying it of course). But it is a product that has been around for years in the shadow of Google Reader only to come out now as the foremost replacement of the latter. <a href="http://reederapp.com">Reeder</a> and other similar apps have promised native RSS fetching in future updates so RSS surely looks secure for now.</p>

<p>As Ben rightly puts it, it all boils down to the privacy trade-off. It&rsquo;s like buying a glass house for free where people can peek into it. But in the other case, you build walls around it with money and stay secured. ​</p>

<p>After all you only get what you pay for.​</p>
