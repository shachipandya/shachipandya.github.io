        <p>Honestly, I couldn&rsquo;t think of a better title.</p>

<p>Everyone knows their weaknesses and the stuff they cannot do. Well at least they think they cannot do. This arises from the fact that they have never actually taken the first step. Sometimes they did. They took the first step but they sucked at it and they turned their backs. They didn&rsquo;t face the challenge. They didn&rsquo;t give themselves the permission to suck.</p>

<p>As David Kadavy explains in <a href="http://kadavy.net/blog/posts/permission-to-suck/">his brilliant article here</a>, we need to give ourselves the permission to suck - it&rsquo;s actually necessary to suck! When we want to do things we always wanted to do but are afraid to take that first step, we should put ourselves out there. We will obviously not know how to do things and we will suck at it. There will be naysayers dragging you back. Don&rsquo;t let them get to you. They are just trying to feed their insecurities. Face your own fears and fight your own battles.</p>

<p>I will tip this with my own story. When I was starting out my stint on the Internet and computers, I hated programming, much of which dates way back to my schooling days. My initial days in programming scarred me for a few years. But computers fascinated me. I always wanted to make websites and play with computers. And more than anything else, I wanted to learn programming because I simply did not want to miss out.</p>

<p>So I sucked it up. I spent hours past midnight trying to figure out how Git worked and how development environments were set up and the usual programming drills. It was tough. I thought about quitting a 100 times. But when I saw people doing the cool things on Internet, I felt left out. I had to do it.</p>

<p>I started again. I started simple. I explored blogging engines, figured out web hosting, setup my own website and then picked up HTML and CSS. Much of all this happened in the last 18 months (a lot of credit to the super-fast Internet here in the Netherlands). Honestly, when I look back at the first website I built back in 2008, I get a bittersweet feeling. It was a crappy design (it&rsquo;s still active) but it was my design. I made that website no matter how much it sucked. And now when I taught myself about Internet, technology and programming, all those midnight hours don&rsquo;t look so bad. They just bring a satisfying smile. And now I know better from all the initial failed efforts.</p>

<p>These times here in Delft have been immensely productive in terms of learning. Mostly because of the perseverance and because I allowed myself to suck. Once you get past that phase, you are through. Nobody is stopping you from doing things you always feared you couldn&rsquo;t do.</p>

<p>As for me, my next target is to design an iOS app. One day</p>
