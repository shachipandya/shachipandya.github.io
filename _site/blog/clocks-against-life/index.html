        <p>Here is another one of my old posts reproduced for keeping. My take on living without the shackles of being time-bound and &lsquo;on schedule&rsquo; all the time.</p>

<p><em>Here goes the original post:</em></p>

<p>I was going to miss it! Yes I was going to miss my train because, I suddenly realized I had only 3 more minutes to walk to the station and it was not India (where the timings always mean 10am plus 30 more minutes of endless wait).</p>

<p>Funny thing being in Europe is that you get reliant to the time-tables and schedules so much so that you forget you have your own mind to control you. You almost feel like the clock hands are pushing you to the laundry machine, to the classroom and to the coffee break. Life is much more than that I would say and hence I think, clocks are against life! Back in India, things were much different and people actually were a bit lenient with the deadlines and timings. Precisely why it takes time for an Indian to settle down here in the professional environment.</p>

<p>So more than ever, I feel a strong urge to remove batteries from my clocks every now and then but of course, I can’t.</p>

<p>Thing with clocks is, they dominate you without you knowing about it. We are all slaves of time.</p>

<p>Here is the inside scoop:</p>

<p>For once, its good to defy all that is forcing you to follow schedules and time-tables. For once, its good to say, “I will do whatever I want to do for next 1 hour”. For once, its good to do nothing according to plan and move away from the line.</p>

<p>Try this: on a day at work, get up from the computer table, take a bike and go for a fun ride. For once, go to a canal and feed the ducks. For once, go to a park and take a walk. For once, have a look at the clock and say “you do not control me”.</p>

<p>Life is all about the irregularities and undecided events. It better be that way. That is how it is supposed to be.</p>

<p>Go out, explore and see things with open eyes. Computer screen can show you things but can never make you feel the aroma, the cool breeze or the effervescent freshness.</p>

<p>I would like to share a video along with all this and would stress on a comment made by the guy under the video: “one of those days when I wonder what I am doing in front of the computer screen all my life”!</p>

<p>Perhaps no video can explain this better than this one here:</p>

<p>Freedom exists between those schedules and appointments. Don’t let it go away. Discover and live free. Rejuvenate yourself.</p>

<p>After all, life is for living, not planning.</p>
