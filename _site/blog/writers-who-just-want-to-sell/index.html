          <h5 class="article-subtitle"></h5>



        <p>Have you ever visited a website or a blog and been showered by useless ads? Has there ever been an occasion when you just wanted to get to the main content but were obstructed by hostile pop-up windows full of things you would never buy? Have you ever felt that the writer is constantly trying to sell you something and is not interested in educating you at all?</p>

<p>I have felt all of the above. And chances are, you have as well. People call themselves bloggers and writers all over the place. I believe there are two types of people who write on the Internet:</p>

<p>The first type are the ones that want to sell something to you. And yes, they are in the majority and I am aware of it. What these blogs do is to constantly shower you with obtrusive advertisements and pop-ups and constantly ask for favours from you. The most obvious one being email newsletters readerships. Now I don&rsquo;t understand this. If we have a huge class of people complaining about &lsquo;too much email&rsquo;, how are there writers expecting their readers to add to that already noisy inbox? If I have 50 unread emails lying in my inbox and your article adds one more to that pile, will I bother reading it? Do you really see having a 10,000 email sign-ups strong readership really worth it? I don&rsquo;t think so. When I visit a blog that asks for my email address so that they can send articles to my inbox, I always have a wry smile. That model for me, is absolutely nonsensical.</p>

<p>Continuing the discussion about these type of bloggers, I have managed to find quite a few of them. And within 2 seconds of visiting a website, you can see that the blogger is a seller and not a writer. He may be a good writer but he does not write because he loves writing, he writes because he wants to make money off of it. I do not like this concept and I believe bloggers shouldn&rsquo;t always see their readers as &lsquo;customers&rsquo;. Come on, can&rsquo;t we for once have something nice to read about without your constant begging for my money or my email address?</p>

<p>Yes we can. And that is the second type of writers. The ones who truly care about sharing what they know and what they think people would appreciate and love to know as well. These are the real writers for me. They provide value. They do not &lsquo;up-sell&rsquo; crap to me and genuinely care about my reading experience. This is a class of people that puts content first and ads (if they do have them) second. This is the class of people that makes me believe in benign advertisement. Yes it is possible to advertise on your blog or website without being a jerk and without obscuring your actual content (for which I am on your site in the first place). These are the people that construct the sane part of Internet for me. They respect their readers and they put content first. Their sites are minimalistic, organised and classy. These blogs and writers leave a lasting impact on you and you feel &lsquo;loved&rsquo; and cared when you visit their sites.</p>

<p>These writers welcome you as a guest in their house and create an experience for you so that you will love to come again. I am not saying that they are always completely ad-free and non-monetizing blogs. In fact, they are actually one of the most successfully operating blogs on the Internet in terms of revenue. In my opinion, it is because they do not succumb to selling but they succumb to their writing habits. If I absolutely have to list out a few of my favourite writers who create a classy experience for me, I would do so with real pleasure. Here goes -</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://ignorethecode.net">Ignore the code</a> - my favourite blog design by far (notice minimalism?)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.marco.org">Marco.org</a>  - unobtrusive ads, content first</li>
<li><a href="http://daringfireball.net">Daring Fireball</a>  - unobtrusive ads, content first</li>
<li><a href="http://zeldman.com">Zeldman.com</a>  - no ads, content first</li>
<li><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com">PaulStamatiou.com</a> - no ads, content first</li>
<li><a href="http://kottke.org">Kottke.org</a>  - RSS sponsorships, content first</li>
<li><a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com">Seth Godin</a>  - no ads, content first</li>
<li><a href="http://mattgemmell.com">Matt Gemmell</a>  - no ads, content first</li>
<li><a href="http://shawnblanc.net">Shawn Blanc</a>  - RSS sponsorships, content first</li>
</ul>


<p>There is a common factor in all of them - content first. There are no pop-ups, almost none or very little &lsquo;<a href="https://twitter.com/halvorson/status/363653318184165376">social sharing</a>&rsquo; crap and a very carefully chosen design philosophy. They all have managed to build their own personalised online brands without being jerks to their readers and that is the reason I enjoy visiting their websites over and over again. They appeal.</p>

<p>It is important however to note how they operate. Not all of them are ad-free. They do have advertisements. But the way they present these ads is very unique and classy. They do so without being sellouts. They still &lsquo;own&rsquo; their websites and content. That is how it should be done. The RSS sponsorships are also very benign. Many of them actually promote the products and stuff that they themselves use and vouch for. There is a whole sense of care and respect for the reader in the design and structure of these websites mentioned in the list.</p>

<p>Now of course this is just my opinion but I completely stand by it. I believe I would leave a website if I don&rsquo;t immediately see the content I came looking for and that must be true for majority of site visitors.  And that is what distinguishes bloggers and writers from &lsquo;marketers&rsquo;. There are people who write just for page-views and click-throughs and there are people who write to genuinely educate and share something they are passionate about.</p>

<p>I do not have anything against those who want to write to sell something. I truly respect their philosophy of writing and generating money from page-views. Everyone&rsquo;s within their rights to do whatever they want on their websites. Just that I am not their customer and would never be. It&rsquo;s just that I would immediately close the browser tab if I see such obtrusion in the way of main content. Because come on, bad content design means you don&rsquo;t respect me as a reader. That is something I cannot tolerate. That is something I do not stand by. A pop-up window asking for my email address is a slap on my face that I will not take again.</p>

<blockquote><p>You earn your money, just not in exchange of my time.</p></blockquote>

<p>As for this website, I want to fall in the &lsquo;genuinely passionate&rsquo; category and hence I have put the content first and it will always be that way. I hope you enjoy reading my articles and do so in future as well</p>
