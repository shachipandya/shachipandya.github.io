          <h5 class="article-subtitle"></h5>



        <p>It&rsquo;s the startup age. There&rsquo;re startups everywhere. In big and small cities, in colleges and universities and in classrooms and hostels. People, especially the youth, are all over this concept of making a living of their own by operating over an idea. Countless incubators and &lsquo;venture&rsquo; funds have emerged over the last 3-4 years. I&rsquo;ve been following the stream of entrepreneurship and startup incubation closely in India (and also abroad) and have some things to share that are strikingly glaringly obvious and concerning.</p>

<a name="Forced.innovation"></a>
<h2>Forced innovation</h2>

<p>Most startups I see nowadays accompany some sort of a website. The thing you could and would do usually by going somewhere physically, can now be done through a website. Making something like this isn&rsquo;t hard. It usually involves getting a website and setting it up for your potential users to use. Easy.</p>

<p>But here&rsquo;s the problem:</p>

<div class="aside">Not all things are possible to do online. You cannot justify building a website for certain things that have values lying in personal interaction.</div>


<p>For example, in India, I see countless website-based startups selling grocery and vegetables online. Nope, that doesn&rsquo;t normally work. Grocery shopping and vegetable shopping is usually done by women in India (I&rsquo;m not being sexist here in any way, it&rsquo;s just an observation). These women usually fall into the age-group of 25 to 55. Most of them do not have access to Internet nor do they have an inclination to do so because buying such things is an experience they want to have. They want to <strong>check</strong> and <strong>verify</strong> the quality of goods before buying. There&rsquo;s just so much personal interaction with local vendors. Buying online isn&rsquo;t an option.</p>

<p><strong>Another example:</strong> I didn&rsquo;t want to name-call but well, it&rsquo;s <a href="http://lenskart.com">Lenskart</a>. One of my friends had a very bad experience with the goods delivered being nowhere close to the goods he chose and purchased online. My wife wears glasses and so does my sister and parents. When we decide to upgrade the glasses or the frames, we like to go to the outlet/showroom and try out different options. It&rsquo;s just not possible to do so online. Usually (I didn&rsquo;t check all of them) such websites even provide returns and re-orders when you are not satisfied but it&rsquo;s quite a tedious process that ultimately makes it not worth it.</p>

<p><strong>There&rsquo;re also factors involved like customer loyalty.</strong> When I go and buy stuff from the same set of shops over and over again, there&rsquo;s trust and loyalty building up. I get preferential treatment alongwith occasional discounts and free stuff. It&rsquo;s such a nice experience to have and results in a win-win for both the seller and the buyer. Internet practically kills that.</p>

<p>Such examples are cases of <strong>forced innovation</strong>. You cannot justify jamming the concept of &ldquo;online&rdquo; in all walks of life. Some things are better left to the discretion of end-user.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not saying that such startups would fail but it&rsquo;s so hard to make a name by having such a business that doesn&rsquo;t have that end-user appeal.</p>

<a name="Possible.solution..amp..advice"></a>
<h3>Possible solution &amp; advice</h3>

<p><strong>Get a better idea.</strong> Think over your idea. Study the mindset of your potential customers. Know exactly who you&rsquo;re targetting. Would they come to your website and decide against the usual norms? Do they have a good enough reason for doing so?</p>

<p>More often than not, the answer would be <em>no</em>. Trust me, I&rsquo;ve seen terrible websites doing terrible financially and eventually shutting down because they didn&rsquo;t do enough research beforehand. Don&rsquo;t fall into the trap. Because it&rsquo;s easy to go this route <strong>and</strong> not worth it.</p>

<a name="Offline.innovation.is.limitless"></a>
<h2>Offline innovation is limitless</h2>

<p>There&rsquo;s so much room for innovation outside the interwebs. The world faces so many problems in supply chains, maintenance of products, low shelf-life of consumables, little to no innovation in the automobile domain, very slow adoption of automation in major industries etc.</p>

<p>For example, we at <a href="http://theoctal.com">Octal</a> build automation products for niché industries coupled by close coordination with clients and directly sell those products to them. This works so well because we find problems our clients face and eradicate those. If network and Internet help us in doing so, we go that route. If not, there are so many mechanical and electronic avenues we can solve their problems with.</p>

<a name="Fact.of.the.matter"></a>
<h2>Fact of the matter</h2>

<p>A website is not a solution for everything. Internet can at best help you with propagation of information and in building businesses that involve trading non-consumable goods. Your target market and psychological stance plays a major role as well. <strong>The concept that succeeded in the Silicon Valley has absolutely no reason to succeed at the same scale in a country like India.</strong> So many factors like economy, psychology, Internet penetration, awareness, logistics, purchasing power and more make or break a healthy environment for startups. Do enough research and validate your idea before jumping all in.</p>

<blockquote><p>My protip: go B2B instead of B2C.</p></blockquote>

<p>But that&rsquo;s for another time.</p>
