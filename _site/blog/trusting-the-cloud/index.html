        <p>Cloud services make everything very easy. By everything, I mean syncing, storage, sharing and collaborating in almost real-time. It&rsquo;s not possible without cloud.</p>

<p>But as services come and grow (and a lot of time, disappear), competition in the cloud market increases and it becomes increasingly difficult to choose the right tools for your need.</p>

<p>A little while ago, my service of choice for photo storage, backup and sharing &ndash; <a href="http://everpix.com">Everpix</a> went spiralling down to closure. Just out of the blue (well that is what it seemed to be like from the consumer point of view), they decided they were shutting down the shop. <strong>Unfortunately, only 24 hours before that announcement, I had fully committed to Everpix to become my go-to photo cloud solution. That sucked!</strong></p>

<a name="Reasons.why.cloud.is.awesome"></a>
<h3>Reasons why cloud is awesome</h3>

<ul>
<li>Ubiquity</li>
<li>No dependence on platform (iOS, Android, Windows Phone and the almighty web)</li>
<li>Peace of mind of data security* (will discuss this in a bit)</li>
</ul>


<p>We all need access to our data all the time on different devices. That is why some files that need frequent access have to be stored on the cloud. *The peace of mind that I mention is about your data being securely stored on multiple locations. Of course nothing is completely secure and safe at any place but at least there will be a backup when my laptop&rsquo;s local copy is destroyed because of my own mistake. The assurance is comforting.</p>

<a name="Reasons.why.cloud.has.trust.issues"></a>
<h3>Reasons why cloud has trust issues</h3>

<ul>
<li>Services go down all the time (service outage = no access to your data)</li>
<li>Services go out of business (they often do, like Everpix)</li>
<li>Services become creepier (ahem, Google)</li>
<li>Ownership of data in cloud is a sketchy issue in itself</li>
</ul>


<p>These are not trivial matters at all. I moved entirely off of Google Apps for my personal use to Outlook (and SkyDrive) for this very reason. Google is getting <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/if-google-crossed-the-creepy-line-how-should-it-repair-the-damage-to-its-image-2013-8?IR=T">creepier by the day</a> and I hate to be a part of their &lsquo;feed-me-all-your-data&rsquo; game. <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/4/25/2973849/google-drive-terms-privacy-data-skydrive-dropbox-icloud">Google Drive does not feel &lsquo;safe&rsquo; at all for anything</a>.</p>

<p>Of course, I would never trust Google with the privacy of my photographs and with their stupid new integration policy of <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/forced-google-plus-integration-on-youtube-backfires-petition-hits-112000-7000023196/">shoving Google+ in your face whenever they can</a>, I think it&rsquo;s obvious that their intentions and motivations are not the same anymore.</p>

<p>Outage and access is another issue. <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/05/30/dropbox-currently-experiencing-widespread-service-outage/">Dropbox faced frequent outages in recent past</a> and the scene was not nice. A lot depends on the syncing engine that drives your everyday work and if that fails during your work-hours even once, it becomes a deal-breaker. <em>Lets accept the fact that implementing such services with near-realtime performance is a technical challenge that has its limitations.</em> We have not yet perfected the art but we are very advanced as things are. <strong>So there is not a lot to complain but it definitely makes a case for not &lsquo;blaming&rsquo; services and rather being extra-sure to keep redundant copies of data.</strong></p>

<a name="There.are.a.few.aspects.while.considering.cloud.services"></a>
<h3>There are a few aspects while considering cloud services</h3>

<p>Make sure you have redundancy.</p>

<ul>
<li>For photos, I have stored them on Dropbox (I&rsquo;m at 159GB maxed out) as well as my laptop&rsquo;s hard drive. I&rsquo;m planning to make one more copy soon.</li>
<li>For my static website (this one), I store its repository on BitBucket, SkyDrive, <a href="http://box.net">Box</a> and Dropbox (I&rsquo;m extra particular for this one).</li>
<li>For all other important documents, I&rsquo;m using Dropbox and SkyDrive.</li>
</ul>


<p>For photos, I would love to have another versatile solution to be able to view them on the fly and share them selectively. Everpix solved everything but it didn&rsquo;t last long. I might consider Flickr or <a href="https://loom.com">Loom</a> but I would always have my local copy for photos.</p>

<p>I am planning to reduce dependency on cloud based tools more and more but you cannot really trust anyone these days. <strong>Reducing tools you use means putting more trust on the ones you do.</strong> For that you have to be absolutely sure. I&rsquo;m not.</p>

<p>By the way, I and <a href="http://aditya.patadia.org">Aditya</a> use <a href="http://hipchat.com">HipChat</a> and <a href="http://trello.com">Trello</a> for managing <a href="http://eventviva.com">EventViva</a> projects and work. HipChat is way better than other solutions out there and a perfect tool for small (&lt;5 member) teams. So is Trello. Trello is made by Joel Spolsky (creator of StackOverflow) and friends so there is not much to debate there in terms of software quality and HipChat is from <a href="http://atlassian.com">Atlassian</a>.</p>

<p>Always be safe and sure when using cloud. <strong>When it comes to your precious data, nobody is your friend and nobody cares for your data more than you do.</strong> But of course, make use of all the technology goodness out there. Be an adopter. Let me know (<a href="mailto:hardik@hardik.co">hardik@hardik.co</a>) what other cloud based tools you use to get value out of in your daily lives.</p>
