        <p>Okay this is pretty awesome. Burning my lips with the overflowing coffee just so the air pockets in the flight path don’t shake it so much to ruin my MacBook is what I think pretty awesome. I don’t know why. This post is being written at the altitude of 11,889 meters over the Afghan mountains somewhere around Kabul.</p>

<p>I hate being emotionally vulnerable and I absolutely hate being vulnerable while other people knowing so! But I think I have been meaning to share this for a long while now and it’s the right time. Living away from the loved ones is tough. Not that I enjoy it and not that anyone enjoys it, sometimes circumstances call for it. I have many friends and people in my circle who live far away and only get to see their families once a year or even less frequently. That is hard. Believe me. I was one of those ‘ditch all the emotional stigma and rock it out in distant lands’ guys. For major part of my life till recent past, I even believed it to be not at all a wrong way to live.</p>

<p>For work, education or any other palpable reason, going away from family means something. When deliberately done, there is a purpose. Purpose can be totally subjective with the people involved and I am not the one to judge. But I tried it myself to see how it turns out. I asked people around me to see how it turned out for them. I met friends from other culture and diversities to take their opinions as well. The semi-conclusion I can derive from all this is really obvious. After a while, we miss our roots. We miss family.</p>

<p>A Dutch friend of mine told me something that actually stirred my thoughts more than anything else. He lived in the States for the better part of his schooling. He was groomed to be more of an American in those early teens and hence loved to be there. But, (of course there is a ‘but’!) as he recalls, festivals and birthdays were not the same. There was something missing. He in turn figured out what when he pondered enough. It was the home that he was missing. He said, (in these exact words) “Christmas might be big in America, but for me, its nothing compared to our own celebrations back home.” The same was heard a lot of times in one or the other format from most of the people I know.</p>

<p>Okay, I will come to the point. Missing your loved ones is not a weakness but quite the opposite. It’s your strength. It’s your love and affection that in turn tells you to go and see them! In these matters, the heart is seldom wrong! All I want to convey is, no matter how far you live and no matter how busy you might be in your work, go meet and spend time with your own people, your family as and when you please. You don’t want to be left with a successful career and a lot of ‘If only…’s in your personal life. The grief of not having done something when the moment was there is pretty damn pungent.</p>

<p>As for me, I am heading back home. For the holidays I have post internship. I am excited!</p>

<p>Good times to come.</p>
