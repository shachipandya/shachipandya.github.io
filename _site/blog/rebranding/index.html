        <p>So this came as a complete surprise and a very happy one at that.</p>

<p><em>So here&rsquo;s a little background story:</em></p>

<p><strong>I had been on the lookout for a shorter domain for a while</strong> - for about 6 months (and even without such a need, I&rsquo;m always on the lookout for great domains and I get a lot of flak for it as well). Because I&rsquo;m a nerd, a few extra characters in the domain name feel awkward and ungainly to me. So I searched for all alternatives of my name and couldn&rsquo;t find many that were still available. My name is fairly common in Indian culture and hence it&rsquo;s futile to expect such domains to be available.</p>

<p>So I looked for options. <a href="http://domai.nr">Domainr</a> is a great tool if you are like me. It shows multiple options with all possibilities around your name. It showed that <strong>hardik.io</strong> was available. The thing with <strong>.io</strong> domains is that they are really expensive. I wasn&rsquo;t ready to commit to spending $50/year for life especially knowing that it&rsquo;s an <a href="http://gigaom.com/2014/06/30/the-dark-side-of-io-how-the-u-k-is-making-web-domain-profits-from-a-shady-cold-war-land-deal/">injustice done by the British</a>. Plus it was&rsquo;t a <strong>.com</strong> or a <strong>.org</strong>! So it was a no.</p>

<p>The <strong>.co</strong> domains were all the rage till a year ago. So I hopped on the trend. I had a brief spell with <strong>hardik.co</strong> but I didn&rsquo;t enjoy it much. Since I found so many people assuming it was a <strong>.com</strong> when I spelled it out over phone. Giving out an email with such a TLD is a nightmare. I missed a lot of emails. So that had to end.</p>

<div class="aside"><strong>No other variations of "hardik" were available.</strong> Not at least in the standard set of TLDs. So I stopped there. I kept what I had - <strong>hardikpandya.com</strong>, lengthy but trusted, verified and very old (in domain terms, an old domain bears a lot of value in terms of search-engine trust).</div>


<a name="Making.a.move.for.hardik.org.and.hardik.com"></a>
<h2>Making a move for hardik.org and hardik.com</h2>

<p>So the first real attempt at recovering either hardik.org or hardik.com was made 2 months ago. I fired up a <a href="http://domainagents.com">DomainAgents</a> account and made offers. I was new back then in this whole domain-dealing craft. So I sent some basic offers from DA&rsquo;s interface. I put $500 for hardik.org and $700 for hardik.com. Whois records for both domains showed that they were owned by some party in the US. I was hoping literally nothing from the whole DA offer attempt. At best I expected an immediate rejection or perhaps even worse - no response from the owners. So there was that.</p>

<p>2 weeks later I received a response from DA that they couldn&rsquo;t contact the owners of respective domains and if I wanted to try for a different domain. That was it. If they were saying so, perhaps they wanted me to increase the bid or they were actually unable to reach the owners. <strong>I gave up.</strong> Because to be honest, even if the bid was accepted, I wasn&rsquo;t really sure if I would&rsquo;ve paid so much to get either of those domains.</p>

<a name="Fast.forward.to.today"></a>
<h3>Fast forward to today</h3>

<p>Today morning, I opened up Domainr and checked what was happening. First I queried <strong>hardik.com</strong>. It&rsquo;s been registered through October 2016. So that&rsquo;s not happening anytime soon.</p>

<p><strong>Then I tried hardik.org and it said it was available!</strong> I was a bit skeptical. Since the thing with Domainr is that they sometimes take a few seconds to update the availability status of a domain. So a domain that looks available might not actually be available and you won&rsquo;t come to know the real status unless you click on the domain from the list and wait for 4-5 seconds to let it update.</p>

<p><figure class="minified">
    <img src="/images/hardikorg.png" style="border: 1px solid #f1f1f1;">
    <figcaption>It remained available after those 5 seconds</figcaption>
</figure></p>

<p>I let those anxious seconds fly. The status didn&rsquo;t change. <strong>The domain was really available.</strong> At standard .org domain pricing too! I couldn&rsquo;t believe this. I had a chance to buy the domain I wanted for no extra money at all (I smiled a little knowing I had offered $500 for this).</p>

<div class="box">The time that elapsed from that moment I came to realize the domain was really available to the moment I owned the domain was 50 seconds.</div>


<p>I was not going to let this one slip.</p>

<p>So from today, I own <strong>hardik.org</strong> and would setup this site on it in a couple of days. Even the email would be hosted on this new domain (hardik@hardik.org). Old domain and email address would work forever.</p>

<p>Such days bring much joy to my life. Because I&rsquo;m a nerd. A proud one at that.</p>
